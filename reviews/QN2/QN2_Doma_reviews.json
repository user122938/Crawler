Great portion sizes and the service was super quick. The lady working there was also really sweet and gave us complimentary bean sprout soup. The place is small but feels very cozy, def recommend!!"

There is an extra 2$ charge for a hot bowl which keeps the bibimbap nice and crispy but it’s totally worth it. We got our food in less than 10 mins and also received complimentary dishes. The atmosphere felt so familiar and cozy and the lady who served us was so sweet and kept checking up on us to see if we needed anything. This place is seriously 10/10!"

There is some kinda weird smell inside restaurant maybe because the room is so small and doesn’t get enough air. Food is good, but Soondubu tastes a little bit light and expensive compared to the other Soondubu I’ve tried. If taste is better, I wouldn’t mind giving a few more bucks of cuz. And it would be great if they can offer Kimchi as sides as Kimchi is the main sides for Korean restaurant, but they only serve small cucumber sides without refill."

The bulgogi kimbap is sometimes nice, but this time it tasted so off... enough that I was upset - The bulgogi tasted spoiled and pickled at the same time. Making matters worse I had the rice cake and dumpling soup and it was inedible. The dumplings tasted freezer burnt stale and ruined what would've been a nice broth.\n\nI always order an 8oz of their fish cake and this time it tasted like a not so great burnt jerky, saturated in some salty sauce that made it inedible.\n\nIve never given this low of a review, (I don't believe in 1 star reviews) - this is NOT a good choice for Korean comfort food if what I was sent is considered edible and tasty. I'm flabbergasted with this meal."

The cheese teokbokki and pork feet (jokbal) here were probably the best I've ever tried, so much better than what could be found in Ktown. Sometimes, I grab kimbab as quick lunch from here and it's great. When the weather is cooler either in the spring or fall, I also enjoy sitting outdoor and have their soup & rice! I tried their hot & spicy veggie and meat stew and it was so flavorful and comforting."

I recommend both, in particular the spicy jokbal if you like your food \"exciting.\" it's essentially jokbal tossed in a spicy sweet and savory sauce then grilled/roasted so things get all caramelized and extra delicious.  I used to typically come here for the kimbap, which are made fresh to order.  Those are always a hit at parties. Don't get the sad old pre-made ones from hmart.  Get kimbap that someone made an effort to make, get them here."

I was never disappointed by their service and quality of food. The price is reasonable. It has clean environment. If you have larger group, it might not be the best place as it is small, cozy and has limited seating place.\nThe complimentary soup with Kimchi in side is always makes you feel good.\n\nTheir Korean dumplings taste good. If you are looking for something fulfilling.. then try Bulgogi Ddugbalgi Bibimbap which is great.\n\nIf you don’t like water with fresh lemon in it, you need to ask her for plain water.\n\nIt’s located in very convenient location. Closer to subway train station, just less than 2 minutes walking.\n\nTry it, you won’t regret!!"

As someone who quite enjoys the pop culture aspects of Korean culture, like the dramas or kpop, I have definitely seen and heard a lot of what I ordered get eaten through a screen. The real life experience is the times better. There is a lot of flavor in each of these meals, that lend itself to a desire to take your time deciphering and enjoying them. The spicy tuna kimbap was by far my favorite, but as someone who likes cooked sushi rolls more than anything, I might have been biased toward kimbap. That being said, it's a delicious roll of cooked food that once again brought the flavor to the next level. When I'm back in new york, I would love to go again! The waitress I had was very kind, and helped me to understand what it was I was enjoying or what the differences were in different styles of what I ordered. Very enjoyable experience."

I lived down on 40th street in Sunnyside for 5 years and frequented Doma every other week, sometimes 2-3 times in a week. I would come in by myself after work, on weekends, or whenever I wanted to treat myself. I always ordered the same meal with the same server, and the incredible food always hit the spot. I get emotional thinking about the memories I made here as it was the first place I felt truly comfortable to eat in the restaurant by myself in silence, just to appreciate and enjoy the experience and the food. I can’t convey how special Doma is in words, but I hope this photo will show a small piece of it. My husband and I moved out of NYC during the pandemic and for my birthday, he commissioned a local NYC artist to paint this favorite memory of my favorite meal at this favorite restaurant of mine. It brings tears to my eyes whenever I see it, and I wanted to share it with you. Please support this small business, thank the owner, pay in cash, and tip heavily. They deserve it and you will leave with a belly full of delicious, comforting food and already looking forward to planning your next visit. Enjoy ❤️"
