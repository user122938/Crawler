            "text": "I ordered the Mie Goreng Seafood and Sumatera's Coffee today, but something strange really stood out to me. The guy (I believe he was the owner) asked me if I wanted the coffee \"black, or with cream\" and if I wanted it with \"white sugar or palm sugar,\" and I simply just said, \"Cold coffee with cream and white sugar\" (very standard, right?). But once I got the check, I was charged $5 for \"Sumatera's Palm Sugar Coffee\" even though that's not what I had ordered. When I asked about it, he said the $3 item was for black coffee (without cream, no palm sugar) but I had specifically ordered it with regular sugar. For reference, the palm sugar coffee was $3.50 on the menu. So even if that was ordered, that means if you want cream in your coffee, it's an extra $1.50.. LOL! I've never seen anything ridiculously overcharged like that in my life! Further, none of these \"additional charges\" were stated on the menu. Maybe he thought I was a tourist, but I digress.\n\nNot to mention, the coffee was nothing special -- mediocre at best -- and the portion of the food was very small for the price compared to other similar restaurants in the area. Needless to say, I will not be returning mainly because of how shady they are, and the portions you get for the food is just not worth it."

The menu's big, but there's recommended menu items that are very good for those who don't know what to get.  It's also halal, which isn't a big deal for me, but is for any Muslims, obviously.\n\nThere's a surcharge on any credit card payments, but not on Zelle or Venmo, so use those when you go.\n\nThis place is consistently good, and I hope to come many times more!"

You will be greeted by friendly people and there are about 2-3 dining tables.\nI ordered the nasi (rice) padang bungkus (wrapped) with ayam goreng (fried chicken), a dish unique to a city of an Indonesian province West Sumatra. The rice comes wrapped in a banana leaf and contains sambal (chili sauces), a tofu, a potato patty, sambal chips, jackfruit, egg, kale, and fried chicken. The sambal sauce/chips really add a kick of spicy, savory flavor that is quite unique to Indonesian cuisine. Places like this make me so glad to be in close proximity to the 5 boroughs and get an authentic taste of international foods. Yay!\nThere are fish and beef combos with this meal instead of the chicken as well. The beef comes in empal (fried) and rendang (dry curry)...hopefully will try that next time.\nMakun yuk (Let's eat!)"

            "text": "If you’re missing the flavors of home, this place is a must-visit Indonesian restaurant that truly captures the essence of authentic cuisine. The moment you walk in, you’re enveloped in a warm and inviting atmosphere that feels like a little slice of Indonesia.\n\nI ordered the nasi bungkus, lontong cap gomeh and pempek palembang (fish cake with spicy sour sauce) and all dishes transported me straight back to my childhood. The nasi bungkus was beautifully wrapped and packed with fragrant rice, tender meat, and a variety of delicious sides. Each bite was a comforting reminder of home-cooked meals, with flavors that felt familiar and nostalgic.\n\nThe lontong cap gomeh was equally impressive. The rice cakes were perfectly steamed, served in a rich and flavorful broth filled with vegetables and protein. It was hearty and satisfying, evoking memories of family gatherings and festive celebrations.\n\nThe service was friendly and welcoming, making the experience even more enjoyable. If you’re craving authentic Indonesian flavors or simply want to reminisce about home, Sumatera resto is the place to be. It’s a true culinary haven that brings the heart of Indonesia right to your plate!"

Everything she recommended I try was delicious and the atmosphere makes me feel as if I’m eating a meal at my parent’s house. If I lived in the area I would be stopping in for lunch. But, I will definitely come back here in the near future."
