            "text": "We came in for brunch, and it turned out to be one of the most disappointing and uncomfortable restaurant experiences I’ve ever had. The hostess was blatantly racist. We waited over 30 minutes for an outdoor table even though there were several clearly available, while multiple parties who arrived after us were seated right away—some even taken by the same hostess who told another employee not to seat us yet. We were only a party of two, yet somehow every excuse was used to delay seating us. When we were finally seated, we asked to sit on the side, but the hostess refused, saying it was reserved for larger groups, and just a few minutes later another party of two was seated exactly where we had asked to sit. It was obvious we were being treated differently because of who we are, not because of seating availability. After checking recent reviews, I saw that others had similar complaints within the same time frame, which confirms this wasn’t an isolated incident. The only positive part of the experience was our server, Kelly, who was professional, kind, and attentive, and honestly salvaged what could’ve been a completely unbearable brunch. Still, no level of good service can make up for racist and discriminatory behavior, and this restaurant seriously needs to address its staff and management before more guests experience the same disrespect. Absolutely unacceptable."

I went with my friend, and we ordered two non-alcoholic cocktails, one pizza, one salmon, and one pasta ($150). The food took about 30–40 minutes to come out, and there was no apology at all. I could understand since the restaurant was busy, but the rude attitude continued.\n\nWhen we finished our meal (took 1hr and 30 mins), we asked for the bill and waited about 10 minutes — still nothing. We had to ask again before it finally came. Because the food was delayed without any apology, we left a $1 tip. Then, the waitress stared at the receipt and even asked if I really tipped only $1.\n\nWhat a rude and unprofessional behavior. Very disappointing experience despite the nice location."

One thing to note is that it is located in the same building as the Time Out Market, so we were walking around looking for a separate building for a few minutes until we realized. We appreciated the fact that they were timely, our reservation was set for 7:15 pm and we were outside seated by 7:25 pm. We sat outside in the middle of October and it was not cold, they had heaters set up all around.\nOur favorite dish was the truffle honey whipped ricotta, incredible! Order their free focaccia bread basket and it goes great with it. Food was good, not excellent but the ambience and the service made up for it. Wonderful date spot / somewhere to celebrate a special occasion! Recommending coming after sunset go get a beautiful view of the bridge."

When we got there, our seats were super cramped ，there was a big plant right behind me and I literally couldn’t stretch my legs.\n\nSo I turned to one of the servers outside, a Black guy with dreadlocks, and said, “Excuse me, can I—” but before I even finished my sentence, he cut me off and said “No.” Just “no.” I swear I didn’t even get to ask the question. It was honestly shocking.\n\nAnother server came over right after, asked what happened, and actually went to check if we could move. He came back and said no, which was fine ，we totally understood. We got permission to shift our seats a little bit just so I could sit more comfortably. Then, that same rude server came back and told me I couldn’t sit like that because I was blocking the walkway. I told him I literally had no space for my legs, and he just said, “No one else has this problem, so you can’t.”\n\nA few minutes later, he even brought another server over to check if I was in the way and of course, everyone said I wasn’t blocking anyone. The whole thing was so unnecessary. And after that, he kept glancing over at our table during dinner like he was trying to prove something. It was honestly ridiculous.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever written a Google review for a restaurant, but this guy deserves it. Everyone else at Cecconi’s was lovely and professional but this one person ruined the whole experience. I still left a tip, but definitely not for him."

The server was completely unempathetic — he took our appetizer order and then disappeared. I had to call him multiple times just to get him to take our main course order. He never checked on our table, not even once to ask if the food was okay.\n\nI ordered a $60 lobster pasta, and it was overcooked and bland — definitely not al dente, and the flavor was just… missing. Nothing about it lived up to the name or the price. There are way better Italian restaurants in the city, honestly. Sorry, but I had to say it.

The real issue came when one of us ordered pasta, and Kristian asked if she wanted truffle on it. He never mentioned that this would come with an additional $35 charge. Naturally, she assumed it was part of the meal.\n\nWhen the bill arrived and we questioned the charge, Kristian’s response was arrogant and unapologetic. He claimed it was “on the menu” and refused to take accountability for failing to disclose the cost. There was no effort to make the situation right, no apology, and no professionalism whatsoever.\n\nThis kind of manipulative upselling without disclosure is deceptive and unethical. For a restaurant with Cecconi’s reputation, this experience was beyond disappointing — it felt like being taken advantage of. If this is the level of service the management condones, it reflects terribly on the entire establishment.\n\nWe left feeling frustrated, unheard, and completely disrespected. I’ve dined at countless restaurants across the city, and this was by far one of the worst interactions I’ve ever had. I genuinely hope management reviews this situation seriously — because no guest should ever be treated this way."

He instantly asked for a refund, as 30% wouldn’t fit the service we got, and then an odyssey started. First, the credit card machine didn’t accept the refund (but accepted the payment in a second). Then, the waiter, who was a bit rude and rushed us to order, had to sort it with the manager what was happening, and at the end and multiple back-and-forth, they couldn’t. This process took at least 25 minutes.\n\nThe manager ended up showing himself in the table and explaining he did the refund and it would took 2-3 business days to be processed, and if it didn’t, to send him an email. We asked for the email and he had to go back inside to grab his business card, which somehow took more 10 minutes - I wonder why he didn’t came with the card already?\n\nUnfortunately, the service sort of ruined a what would be a great experience for us."

While the food here was undeniably high quality, it really lacked in flavor—which was disappointing, especially since this spot had been on my must-try list for years.\n\nThat said, the restaurant itself is beautiful, with a cute outdoor seating area. Our server was attentive and helpful, and the overall experience wasn’t bad. I just wish the food had lived up to the setting."

            "text": "We had a reservation for outdoor dining, specifically chosen to accommodate our son(kid) who has autism. Outdoor seating is important for us, as indoor environments can be overstimulating for him and potentially distressing for other guests. Despite our reservation and arriving on time, we were told there was no outdoor table available for us.\n\nInstead, we were offered indoor seating right in the path of busy servers and we explained why that wouldn’t work for our family, the staff member assisting us (an African American woman) responded, “You guys can wait at the bar counter, but I don’t know how long you’ll have to wait,” with noticeable attitude and zero apology. Asking a party of 4 adults and 2 children to wait at a bar counter indefinitely felt both unreasonable and dismissive. Especially because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get to that indoor table.\n\nWe were stunned by the lack of empathy or accountability. Just as we were about to leave and look for another restaurant, the manager stepped in and suddenly a table outside became available. While we appreciated being seated in the end, it was clear that the situation could have been handled better from the start.\n\nThe entire experience was disheartening. A reservation should mean something, especially when there’s a valid, sensitive reason behind it. Unfortunately, this experience left us feeling unwelcome and disappointed. We won’t be returning."

            "text": "On Friday, 5/23/25, I celebrated my son’s college graduation with dinner inviting family and friends. I have been communicating with Jillian, Cecconi’s private events assistant manager, since March to set up this dinner. I am extremely pleased and happy that I chose Cecconi’s for this moment. Last night was absolutely wonderful!! ☺️  I didn’t drink as much as I’d have liked because I was too busy interacting with my family and friends. I loved that everyone was enjoying themselves. It was cool seeing my son’s and his friends having a good time. Am I biased because of the moment I was celebrating? Maybe….. but the food was delicious and the service was great.  Jose and the other gentleman whose name I can’t remember were wonderful. Both of them were pleasant and gracious.\n\nEntrees were eggplant parmigiana, chicken paillard, and salmon broccolini with sides, of course.\nDessert was tiramisu and lemon sorbet.\nThese dishes are from the private events menu selection. Nevertheless, all were delicious. You can view the regular menu to Cecconi’s Dumbo on their website or Google.\n\nThis review is based on the private events space so the price per person is $100+ because of that. However, if you walk in or reserve a table the cost per person could definitely be less depending upon your meal and drink.That review is the next paragraph.\n\nI first came to Cecconi’s the second week of May 2025 to check out the restaurant and the space I had a contract for. After meeting with Jillian, 2 of my friends and I had a meal. The service that day was very good. No complaints at all. I had a reservation for 3 and we chose to sit on the outside part of restaurant. It was a delicious meal, delicious drinks and a beautiful view.\n\n*The pic of the rigatoni bolognese was when I had a late lunch with my 2 friends.*"

            "text": "I just had lunch there with my wife and we ate at the bar. So that’s a good tip right there. People were waiting at the door and the staff was taking names but we waltzed right in. You can often do that if you’re willing to sit at the bar which, let’s fact it, is often more interesting than a table. The bar had plenty of seating and we had a view of the two bridges and the water. Service was great. We had avocado and chick pea dip with crudités and wow, the crudités were gorgeous. I’ll post a photo. also had two drinks, the branzino (very flavorful) and the calamari appetizer. It was a lovely afternoon. The staff was great. They did bring a second order of our entrees thinking we had not been served yet but that’s a mistake I can live with. Of course, we did not eat twice but I’m sure someone got their food quickly at another table. :) Total tab without tip was $144. It’s a little pricey but you have to consider the view……"

            "text": "The place is beautiful. We wanted to seat outside but it was raining. The food was great. However, there was a bridal shower or something similar that had ended and some stuck around and they were drunk and talking really loud, almost yelling and no one said anything to them, it was uncomfortable because they were standing up taking up so much space.\nBesides that, the food was great. We had the ricotta whipped with honey (SOOO good), the calamari, and pizza. The tiramisu was amazing as well.\nDon’t order the juices unless you want a store bought one. The ingredients aren’t completely listed on their menu. I ordered one that had turmeric or something and when it arrived the bottle also said “natural flavors,” etc so its not a natural juice."

Our server Jose and the sexy friendly manager fralipe were both so attentive. Cocktails were nice and strong exactly how I like them. Seafood pasta was nice and endive salad was delicious. My husband ordered the branzino and it was cooked perfectly. Glad we decided to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary at Cecconi. Normally we go to manhattan to either Avra Madison or Momoya. We will be back very soon☺️☺️🫶🫶"

Our dishes were cleared,our glasses constantly filled and the whole staff had a great attitude from the moment we walked in. The food was very good and the price is a bit on the high side. But it's in a busy high end,touristy area so the prices are what is expected. They add a service fee/tip for groups over 6 or 7."

It has an elegant vibe with a hint of the ‘70s, a beautiful view of the Hudson River, and a classy Italian atmosphere that’s made to be enjoyed slowly.\n\nWe ordered several dishes to share: truffle pizza with goat cheese, a classic margherita, fried calamari, fresh hamachi, ricotta and spinach ravioli, and a perfectly cooked salmon with a crispy skin. To drink, we had a couple of beers and an espresso martini, which was spot on. Everything was flavorful and well presented, and the service was super friendly throughout.\n\nA place that blends great food, a well-designed ambiance, and a view that invites you to slow down and enjoy."

The ambiance is elegant yet cozy, making it perfect for a romantic evening or a special gathering.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re looking for authentic Italian cuisine paired with breathtaking scenery.

But I advise everyone to avoid waiter number 1323! He is terrible! After you sit down! He must ask you to order food! If you don't order food, you can't sit at the table, you have to sit at the bar! And he interrupted me and my friends many times to force me to order! The service from beginning to end was very bad, very bad！Actually, who doesn't have money for tips? It's just a few bucks, right? Who doesn't have that little money? I just don't want to give it to him because I really think his service is terrible! When I first came in, I said I was very hot and asked if I could have a drink first and order slowly, but he said no! You have to order right away! When I was video chatting with my friend, he came over to interrupt my chat many times! Forced me to order! I think the service was terrible, so I don't want to tip you. It's not about the money at all. I spent $22, so the tip is just a few bucks, right? Who doesn't have a few bucks? But is your service really appropriate? The key is at the end! This person actually came to argue with me over a few dollars of tip! Accused me of not tipping! And he went to the front desk and told me that I would not be allowed to come in to consume in the future! My God! Such a service staff is still reasonable? ? ? ? Your service is not good, I refuse to give you a tip! The waiter actually quarreled with the customer? He also ran to the front desk and told the front desk staff that he would refuse to let me enter the store in the future! I'm sorry, I have lived in New York for so long, I have lived in the United States for so long, I always give tips and I always give good tips! I just don't like it, I am not satisfied, you just don't want to give you a tip, I don't want to give you a dollar! Number 1323!"
