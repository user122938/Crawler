Even when it’s packed, they keep things moving without making you wait forever. The lagman is next lever, just perfect. The meat is always fresh, and if you’re picky, they’ll make sure you get exactly what you want. Also every night there’s a DJ, so the atmosphere is always on point.

It was very aesthetically pleasing - I especially love when a restaurant matches its food theme to its decor. I was so impressed with the way this place looked, that I did have a thought in the back of my mind that the food would not match up.\nBut thankfully I was wrong! We didn't order much, but whatever we did get was so good. The food was fresh, but more importantly tasted great.\nWe ordered 2 soups (lagman and shurpa), garden salad, Lola kabob and bone in chicken (they had run out of meat sticks 😔), French fries with garlic, manti, and half a leposhka.\n\nFood highlights: bread was fresh and warm, a perfect combo of soft inside and crispy outside.\nFrench fries had the garlic mixed into it which I really appreciated. I don't like when restaurants just plop some crushed garlic right on top, so this to me is going the extra mile! The two skewers came with grilled veggies and the tomato was fantastic! I'm not a big fan of the Shurpa soup, but my wife really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the lagman as it was delicious and generously portioned.\n\nThere was also a saxophone player for a little bit which was a nice added touch.\nI definitely will be visiting again very shortly!"

It describes its cuisine as Central Asian and Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nThe dishes served are similar to many of the Bukurian restaurants in the area. They focus on samsas, kebabs and other heavy meat meals. There are some fish dishes but that doesn't seem to be its main focus. It's not a place to go if you are not very hungry, but if you are, the food is great. Service is also very good. The staff does a good job of explaining the various dishes on the menu.\n\nThe decor here is amazing, similar I imagine,to a Central Asian tent. There are elaborate rugs and other decorations. The restaurant has recorded and has live music .  A visit to Art of Grill is a unique experience and is highly recommended."

            "text": "I recently had the opportunity to dine at Art of Grill, a Bukharian restaurant that offers an authentic culinary experience. Before delving into my review, I must acknowledge that cultural differences may influence one's perception of this establishment, as it adheres to Bukharin cultural norms. Keep in mind that my review might not reflect how others perceive the restaurant.\n\nLet's start with the food, which I found to be absolutely fantastic. The dishes were incredibly authentic, delicious, and prepared with fresh ingredients. From the first bite to the last, I was impressed by the quality and flavors of the cuisine. I would rate the food a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nHowever, there was one aspect of my dining experience that bothered me, as well as many other patrons—the choice to hire a DJ. Unfortunately, the music played by the DJ far exceeded an acceptable noise level for a restaurant. Numerous patrons requested the DJ to lower the volume, but he would argue with them, claiming that the music wasn't too loud. This constant back-and-forth made it difficult to relax and enjoy the meal. The music was painfully loud, to the point of hurting our eardrums. I personally approached the DJ and politely asked him to turn it down, but his response was far from satisfactory. He asked me how much he would be paid to do so, which is not the kind of reply one expects from a professional in a restaurant setting. Throughout the evening, the patrons had to lower the volume themselves around 15 times while the DJ was absent, only to have it raised back to an unbearable level upon his return.\n\nAnother incident that troubled me was the presence of hookah smoke inside the restaurant, especially with children around. Although I'm not intimately familiar with New York City laws, I'm almost certain that smoking hookah indoors is prohibited in restaurants. However, Art of Grill allowed it, which was both surprising and disappointing.\n\nFor these reasons, I regretfully have to give Art of Grill a poor score. Despite the excellent food, the overall dining experience was marred by the constant battle with the DJ over the music volume and the disregard for the rules concerning hookah smoke. It was a challenging task to truly enjoy ourselves at the restaurant. I hope that the management takes these concerns into account and addresses them to ensure a more pleasant atmosphere for future patrons."
