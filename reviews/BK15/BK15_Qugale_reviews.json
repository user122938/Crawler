Но поведение персонала и отношение к посетителям полностью перечёркивают всё положительное. Мы пришли с подругами отпраздновать день рождения и заранее забронировали стол. В итоге нас посадили в комнату, где были только мужчины, и атмосфера сразу стала напряжённой.\n\nМужчины за соседним столом начали отпускать в нашу сторону неприличные, сексуализирующие комментарии и шутки. Мы обратились к персоналу с просьбой вызвать менеджера. Пришла женщина-блондинка, которая, услышав нашу ситуацию, ответила: «Такого не может быть, это наши люди.»   как будто мы всё выдумали.\n\nЯ повторила, что поведение мужчин делает нас некомфортно, особенно учитывая, что мы   группа подростков, отмечающих праздник. Менеджер фактически обвинила нас во лжи, но пообещала “поговорить с ними”. После этого стало только хуже шутки продолжились, стали ещё громче, но никто из персонала больше даже не поинтересовался, как мы себя чувствуем.\n\nАтмосфера этого заведения напоминает не ресторан, а дешёвый бар, где женский комфорт не приоритет. Если бы мы знали, куда на самом деле идём, мы бы никогда не выбрали это место. Поведение гостей отвратительное, но особенно пугает равнодушие и пассивная агрессия со стороны персонала.\n\nЕсли вы ищете место, где можно спокойно отдохнуть не волнуйтесь, вместо отдыха вы получите пристальное внимание от пьяных мужчин. Категорически не рекомендую"

Нам по 16 лет, случилась отвратительная ситуация, что один из посетителей ресторана - мужчина средних лет засматривался на одну из моих подруг, не давал покоя, не давал нормально поесть. Мы пару раз вежливо сказали чтобы он отстал от нас, и этот мужчина и пару других мужчин «отклонили» нашу просьбу. Поэтому мы обратились к менеджеру данного заведения, рассказали что и как, и нам тупо послали. Сказав, что эти отвратительные мужчины - их знакомые и постоянные посетители, и они не будут ничего предпринимать, и в итоге ничего не сделали, так еще плюсом, назвали одну из моих подруг лгуньей, за то, что та якобы наклеветала, хотя она просто попросила персонал, чтобы они обратились к этим мужчинам с просьбой перестать досаждать нам. Сервис во 👍Спасибо очень классно посидели🥰🥰"

The salad was chunks of barely cut HARD vegetables. Lamb khinkali was decent/good. Hachapurri was terrible. Wine that’s not on their menu was red and ice cold, why???\n\nThe service is the worst part. Any questions on the menu were met with animosity and I am Russian speaking and frequently eat Georgian food. I can’t imagine being an American and how I’d be treated here. We got dirty looks and nobody came over to serve us. We would’ve ordered more but nobody cared to come to us. Then they blasted the music although we were the only people there. That was our cue that we are being kicked out.\n\nAtmosphere is laughable. Room #1 is a red cave live basement with chalk graffiti from visitors/friends. Room #2 is where the men go to smoke\n\nSo many better places for Georgian food."

The staff was not only attentive but also incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food – it was nothing short of exquisite. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, bursting with flavors that left my taste buds in awe. The fusion of ingredients was both creative and harmonious, making every bite a delight.\n\nI highly recommend trying their signature dish, the Qugale Special. It's a true representation of their culinary prowess. For dessert, the chocolate lava cake was a sweet ending to a perfect meal.\n\nQugale truly stands out in terms of both food and service. If you're looking for a memorable dining experience, don't miss the opportunity to visit this gem of a restaurant. It's a place where food becomes art, and every visit promises a gastronomic adventure."

I stepped outside, opened the box with baby khachapuri for $20! I came back to get an explanation, so I’ve been told  “prices went up sorry”. I could get the whole pie for this amount of money.\nNext time will order somewhere else.\n\nBy the way, you can see on a picture how little cheese they put on it.\nVery disappointed."

Одно слово - ГРУЗИНЫ!!!\nIf you decide to visit this restaurant please take my friendly advice and try to park as close as you can possibly find a spot. The reason: portions are enormous and the food is so good and tasty that you'll have hard time stopping eating.\nService and hospitality are matching the food. To say it in one word - The Georgians!"

Most of the thing I ordered was very very bad.\nHinkali had hair inside. The chicken in garlic sauce was horrible, the chicken was extremely dry and over cooked, the sauce was more like a soup and didn’t even have garlic in it. Was later told that they had prepared it earlier in the morning and served it to me in the evening.\nThe liver cubes were so over cooked that it was more like a crunchy meat cracker. Was told that a lot of people complained about this, why not just take it if the menu of the chef doesn’t know how to make it 🤷‍♂️ Aside from that the only think I did enjoy was the salad, very delicious.\nMost probably will not go there again."
