It’s a bold creation: grass-fed beef, a fried pineapple ring, house‑pickled beets, harissa mayo, and a sunny-side-up egg all stacked on a ciabatta bun. The combination—sweet, savory, rich, and unexpected—works in delicious harmony.\n\nMore than just the food, Five Leaves carries a distinct personality. The interior blends vintage nautical charm with urban intimacy—think cozy corners, worn textures, and a relaxed, hipster‑friendly vibe."

I know pancakes usually have a simple flavor and that’s fine. But for $22 you would expect something more. A hint of citrus a touch of something fresh anything to make it feel worth it. But no. Just fluff with zero taste. The strawberries had this weird garlic-like flavor the bananas were brown overall a total letdown.\n\nEven the table next to me sent theirs back. I don’t know why but it seemed like they also noticed something off.\n\nDon’t trust places hyped by people who grew up eating bland food and now call anything trendy amazing. If you have a real palate especially if you are Brazilian this place will likely disappoint you."

We were almost done with our meal and no one had been seated in the section we asked to move to. Eventually, we just asked for the check and packed up our food.

We went on a weekday around 11am, so it wasn’t too busy, which made it even more enjoyable. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm welcome by the friendly staff. That energy sets the tone right away!\n\nI’d read about the Ricotta Pancakes and had to see what the fuss was about, they did not disappoint. We also had the Grain Bowl with a side of steak and halloumi, and every bite was packed with flavor and texture.\n\nI don’t drink alcohol, but I love\na good mocktail. “Waters of Life” was a winner—especially if you’re into bold ginger and turmeric flavors like I am.\n\nBest part? You can treat yourself without breaking the bank. Trust me, this spot is a gem. I’ll definitely be back soon!"

Can’t but help but think as the only Black and visibly trans patron in this establishment that the real inconvenience was having to serve me. The difference in how I was treated compared to white patrons was palpable. The host seemed annoyed when I asked for a table and the server literally changed his tone from bright and welcoming to flat whenever he had to address me. The restaurant was half empty so the lack of service cannot be blamed on staff feeling overwhelmed. I left a 40% tip in hopes that the tipping pool takes care of the people of color working in back of house. If you’re Black or a person of color steer clear."

            "text": "At the corner of Bedford and Lorimer, across from McCarren Park, Five Leaves hums with the ritual of weekend brunch. Its weathered façade and amber-lit interior suggest a bistro pastiche—half Brooklyn, half borrowed memory. The peeling bathroom walls, the worn wood bar, the stickered entryway: all curated to a rustic perfection that feels accidental by design.\n\nWe ordered the Egg Sandwich, the Big Breakky with steak, and a latte. The food delivered: the egg sandwich was soft, well-sauced, and satisfying; the steak, properly charred and flavorful; the chorizo, boldly salty; and the scrambled eggs, golden and elegant. The mushrooms were earthy, though less memorable. The latte, however, was forgettable—an afterthought in a city of coffee ambition.\n\nStill, to judge Five Leaves on food alone would miss the point. This is a brunch of scenes and roles—young families, hungover couples, stylists taking meetings, dogs under tables. The vibe, not the menu, is what draws the line that wraps around the corner."

The egg sandwich has a rich, cheesy flavor, and the tomato sauce adds a great extra layer. I especially liked the sautéed mushrooms on the big breakfast—they have a unique herbal/spiced taste that stands out. The latte was just okay.

            "text": "I’ve had dinner here twice in the past week, and I’ll start with the good news... the food is genuinely great. Unfortunately, the service doesn't match the quality coming out of the kitchen.\n\nHere’s what happened both times: if you order an appetizer, your main dish gets delayed because the chef is timing it as a \"coursed meal\", even if you order something small like truffle fries. No one explains that up front. So while you’re waiting, you’ll notice other tables who arrived after you getting served before you. It’s confusing and honestly frustrating when you're hungry and just trying to enjoy your evening.\n\nThe staff didn’t seem particularly attentive either. Not unfriendly, just not very present or aware of how long we were waiting. A little communication would have made a big difference.\n\nI really wanted to love the full experience here, which was probably the reason for my return. However, the food alone almost made me overlook the service issues. But after two visits with the same pattern, it’s hard to ignore.\n\nIf you go, just know you’re in for great food but the overall dining experience might leave something to be desired."

So good, perfectly dressed, a little spicy, and topped with toasted hazelnuts 😋 Also got the ricotta pancakes, super fluffy with honeycomb butter. Very good. The spicy chicken sandwich hit the spot but not a must order.\n\n💕 ricotta pancakes $22\n💕 black kale salad $16*\n💕 spicy chicken sandwich $20\n\n날씨 풀리면 사람 꽉 차는 브런치 맛집. 익숙한 메뉴들이 많지만, 그중 최고는 케일 샐러드! 살짝 매콤하고 구운 헤이즐넛 토핑이 넘나 조화로움 😋 리코타 팬케이크도 주문했는데 엄청 폭신하고 허니콤 버터랑 잘 어울린다. 스파이시 치킨 샌드위치는 낫배드."
