I ordered the chicken bowl which absolutely delicious. The meal was plated beautifully. Every ingredient was fresh and I truly enjoyed eating my meal. My mocktail was great as well. Special thank you to Brian who made sure that I was fine and satisfied during my visit. Thank you to The Lowery Bar & Kitchen!\n\nI visited The Lowery Bar & Kitchen about two days ago. Kasper, the bartender was very nice and attentive. I asked for a mocktail and he created one that wasn’t on the menu which was really cool.\n\nI didn’t order any food because I wasn’t hungry but I did order the giant pretzel to take home.\n\nAlthough, I didn’t stay too long I definitely enjoyed my visit. I will definitely visit again in the near future."

Warm greeting even with one person holding down the fort at the time.\n\nNow the food and drinks.  Both great, the Moscow mule was not gingery but tasty, tart, enjoyed it. Chicken sandwich was served in a sort of toasted slice bread.  Not my preference but I actually still enjoyed it.  Having eaten it sliced made it more manageable to eat then other places lol.\n\nNo complaints, great service, great food, will be going back.\n\nP.s.  Nice touch, having a curtain block the front door from that nasty cold draft of air during the winter."

The wait staff was efficient and attentive but not intrusive. The poached eggs were absolutely perfectly cooked. The breakfast platters were amply sized.\n\nCons: the pork sausage was lackluster and hard and kind of spongy. Not a fan. The sound needs attention - they could use sound dampening canvases or something as the voices really bounce off the walls, tables and floors creating a bit of a cacophony as more folks come in to eat. I would say for those of us with noise sensitive make sure you bring your noise blocking headphones so you can hear the folks at your own table.\n\n5 stars as the only bad things are my personal preferences - the quality and atmosphere are great\n\nBonus - this is a pub/tavern type atmosphere and does not smell like stale old beer seeped into the floor. Unlike many taverns and pubs this one smells good"

We are regulars so we've basically tried everything and they're all delicious. The pork bao buns and the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich are particular favorites!

Searched for a Bar/Pub/Eatery in the Sunnyside area, in hopes of finding a place with good food, service, and prices!\n\nAnd, we certainly found the perfect combination - in every way possible! We were greeted by a staff member - in a very friendly and warm way - and were immediately seated, as there was no wait for a party of 2.\n\nOur waitress (Jane) came over after a few minutes, and she was truly the shining jewel of our experience! Jane was friendly, warm, and genuinely nice - and helped us with questions we had about food and drinks.  She recommended their burger (which was simply PERFECT) - did I mention PERFECT - and made our first dining experience at Lowery, a very memorable one (in the most positive way possible).\n\nThe burger was juicy and flavorful, and smothered in cheese (which is an add on) a garlic mayo, crispy onions, and pickles.  Absolute burger heaven.  Fries were EXCELLENT! Drinks were perfect too - and above all the service and attentiveness of Jane was TRULY AMAZING!\n\nA beautiful dining experience overall - and I look forward to going again, very soon!\n\nCHEERS!!! 🌼🌼"

Their happy hour $2 off draft beers is pretty misleading since it only applies to two beers, Stella and something else. The brussel sprouts were delicious but super overpriced, for something you can easily make at home. Fish and chips were good, and appropriately served with malt vinegar. Veggie burger was okay, though I'm not a fan of burgers that get super mushy in the middle and the beet spread that came with it sounded better than it actually was, and took away from the burger. Going with some roasted beets on the side would probably be a better move and keep everything from getting extra soggy too. Honestly wouldn't come back, the outdoor seating out front is also plagued with little flies that aren't shy and will end up all over your food and floating in your drinks. Really more of a two star restaurant for me but our waiter was great and they make a good margarita so at least there's that."

At first there was no one for about 5 minutes  to greet us while it was only busy at the bar. Once we sat down we enjoyed  the appetizers until it was the time for the entree. Once they took our appetizer plates, not even a minute later we received our entrees. Which   they probably have been cooked and ready for a while and been sitting there. We ordered  2 salmon which was an extra 10 dollars  and a burger.\nThe salmon dish was supposed  to have fingerling potatoes, instead came with zucchini.  There  was a lemon puree which  was in the bottom. It was the strongest  sour disgusting sauce I ever had. It made the whole plate awful. So we asked for a separate dish and ate only the salmon. I would have paid 20$ not 35$ for just the salmon. I was so happy that no of the sauce  touched it. Then was dessert which was good. In all I wouldn't  eat that dish ever again."
