We didn’t know if the food would be enough (we have 6 people), so we also ordered the cumin beef. I thought it was just okay, but the veggies were great!!!!

We chose the mild one, which was just right to add a mild kick for us. You can choose a minimum of 5 inclusions which range from meat, seafoods, vegs, and noodles. They will cook it for you. The taste was so temptingly delicious especially the meat; the shrimps were big; only the cuttle fish was a little overcooked that the pcs came chewy 4/5\nThe pork soup dumpling is also a plus, but a thinner dough is preferable. 3/5\nThe ginger/soy/vinegar sauce complimented it\nThe coco milk was just perfect for a drink, not sweet and the coco milk itself was not overpowering 4/5\nThe jasmine tea is great, too 5/5\nThe bottled sparkling orange juice is just right, too 4/5\nThere was a complimentary black gelatin with syrup as dessert. 4/5\nThe strips of seaweeds which was a complimentary appetizer was ordinary\nWe will try other dishes next time around."
