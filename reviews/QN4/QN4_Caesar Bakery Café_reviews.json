I have tried the nachos and the tinga quesadilla and both are incredible. The regular nachos come in a shareable platter enough for two to three people, with sauces on the side ( when u ask for them) and the quesadilla has a corn tortilla that is so fresh, warm and crispy.\n\nThe desserts are incredible as well. I have tried the carrot cake which is by far my favorite slice but it truly is hard to decide with all their many other options. The crème brûlée is fresh, creamy and with the perfect hint of sweetness. The peach cake is also very good with a light chantilly cream.\nThis place is truly amazing & one of my highly recommended spots."

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and fast service that made me feel right at home.\n\nThe breakfast menu is loaded with delicious options — I ordered the classic egg and cheese sandwich on a fresh-baked bagel with crispy bacon, and it was cooked to perfection. The home fries were golden and flavorful. The coffee? Smooth, rich, and expertly brewed. ☕️\n\nWhat sets K & E Cafe apart is the attention to detail, clean and comfortable atmosphere, and genuinely kind staff. Whether you’re dining in or grabbing a quick breakfast to go, this place nails it every time.\n\n📍 Perfect for commuters, families, and foodies alike — it’s a true hidden gem breakfast cafe that deserves way more attention on Google Maps and Yelp.\n\nI'll definitely be back and will be recommending K & E Cafe to anyone looking for a top-rated breakfast or brunch spot in the area.

It’s a small place but I’m always able to dine in because many people order to go if they come here.\n\nI got a regular platter (toast, eggs, bacon, home fries) and a large latte for $15 total?! For me, that’s cheap eats for home cooked food (I have trouble finding this elsewhere).\n\nThe food quality?? SO good. I can eat the home fries forever if they weren’t so filling. I’ve never tasted home fries so juicy and flavorful before.\n\nThe employees are sooo sweet. Some days I can get a little anxious talking to people, but they’re very sweet and help me as best as they can."

            "text": "This place was AMAZING! I absolutely recommend it to anyone. The inside is very small, but I noticed a lot of people get to go orders. The food was delicious. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu. The coffee was really good too. The green sauce they gave me was perfect. I literally can not explain how much I loved their \"hash browns.\" I'd call them potatoes, but they are on the menu as hash browns. The parking wasn't that bad. We went here around 11, so the street parking wasn't too full. The service was very good and it didn't take long to get our food. The atmosphere was cozy and cute. It's totally worth trying this place, and if you live in the area, it will probably be your new favorite spot. YUMMMMMMY!"

So I asked for a refund and they gave it to me.\nI highlight that the customer service and the staff are very good and friendly.\nthe bad thing is that their bakery is not fresh and it is not good. If the product is not fresh, you have to change it and keep it fresh if you want to keep a good clientele."
