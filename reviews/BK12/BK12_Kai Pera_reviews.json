I was confused if it was a restaurant or a basic pizza shop and was told it was a restaurant...We asked for water for the table and never got so i paid for bottle water instead......thier smoothie machine was broken. Thier instagram pictures look  sooo much more delicious then in real life. Their pizza was great the falafel was delish...the penne wasn't too good at all....my homemade one is better  everything took a while to get to the table. Love that the store is big and spacious and clean....I would deffinetly give them another chance and hope for a better time with my kids."

Their food was delicious with generous portion sizes and shockingly good prices. I don’t remember the last time I ordered a pasta dish for only $20.\nThe food was so so good.\nOur favourites were:\nSweet sriracha cauliflower\nAll the soups - just all of them\nBasil cream dream\nGarlic oregano cheese crust pizza\nHaloumi salad\nSweet potato & feta salad\n\nDesserts were delicious as well. I personally would have liked to see some more chocolate or peanut butter based desserts other than the classic souffle and cheesecake\n\nService was great. Thank you so much to the chefs and wait staff for being so accommodating and friendly and showering our birthday boy with all the attention.\n\nI highly recommend this place."
