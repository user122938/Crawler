She told me there was no one to talk to and she got up and went outside at my request. A place without service and without honesty.  Save Yitzchak's soul from this place.\n\nJust a place to sting customers\n\nבקרתי בקפה פריז ,השירות גרוע ביותר  המלצרים רמאים וללא הבנה בשירות לקוחות . חיובתי על מוצרי שלא בקשתי ,וכן חיובתי על דמי שירות על אף שלא אכלתי במסעדה   פניתי לאחרית משמרת להבין את החיובים.  אמרה לי שאין עם לדבר והיא קמה והלכה החוצה בקשתי  .מקום ללא שירות וללא ישרות . שמור נפשו ירחק ממקום זה ."

I usually dine at Renaissance Cafe when I’m the mood for dairy but I wanted to try something new so decided to try this place. First red flag was that my husband and I were the only diners there on a Thursday night.. literally not one person walked in the whole time. Second my eyeballs almost fell out when I open the menu and read the prices $65 for Seabass? That’s more than a steak at the loft! $30 for an arugula salad? I got the mozzarella basket for $30 which I was topped with sweet chili sauce for sure from a glass bottle. Horrible. then I ordered the arugula salad, but they had no arugula left, so I got it on Romain lettuce instead and my husband got the fettuccine Alfredo.. i honestly don’t even know what to say.. to say the food was horrible is an understatement.. i hope the owner sees this and if he does here is a word of advice; your prices are absolutely INSANE! You are a dairy restaurant with meat restaurant prices. The Loft justifies its prices by having the best meat restaurant in Brooklyn so in order to justify your prices, you need to be the BEST dairy restaurant. You offer very few options in each category and every single one needs to be the best and everything needs to be available at all times. Your restaurant was out of arugula and spinach, that’s ridiculous.. I hope you do take my advice because over priced restaurants don’t last long… you want to be one of those “I can’t wait to come back” places  not the “never again”"

There were not many other diners there, but the service was, as I said, not so good. Also, the entres were not timed well at all. So the ones that were the quickest to prepare were brought out first. The problem is that some in our party were  almost finished by the time the others were just starting.  The worst problem was one of our party requested no tomatoes in his selection.  However, his meal was loaded with them. To sum up food is good but expensive and service is poor."

Menu had plenty of options.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly busy and there might not have been enough wait staff. The wait staff weren't warm and welcoming but they were polite.\n\nThe service was pretty slow and we needed to check on our order a few times.\n\nIf visiting again, I would only do so at off hours. Staff would do well to smile and make customers feel valued even if they are in a rush."

The waitresses are the face of the restaurant,  without them the restaurant would be just a regular place where you eat.  They explaining in details in what you are confused,  and making you to choose the best of it..  The only weird thing in restaurant is that,  the waitresses don't t get tips,  as if the tips are included once you pay the bill,  but unfortunately they don't t get tips,  that s why I suggest you all customers to pay extra cash and give them personally,  cuz the owners put tips in their own pocket,  again dear customers once you pay bill,  give extra cash tips to waitresses,  cuz they don't t get payed good,  or don't get the tips..

They brought the omelette without the toast, fries without the sandwich. Half an hour later after the omelette and fries are cold, I get a sandwich for sure. It wasn't the traditional grilled cheese sandwich.  It was a sesame seed baguette bread with little bit of mozzarella cheese -barely edible. They are pricy as well, 40.00 for an omelette and fries,  a coffee and coke. I guess the bread which arrived late was expensive. Also, they are NOT vegetarian. They serve to pescatarians and have fish on their menu. I do NOT recommend and we will not go back there. >_<"
