Everything tastes fresh and flavorful. Dining in option is not really a highlight, as the place gives off an ambiance of a fast food restaurant. Thankfully the high quality food they offer, does not match the atmosphere. Service is always friendly and fast paced."

The unfriendly young man behind the counter misunderstood our order and added extra items increasing the bill. Needless to say it’s also super expensive here, especially for a place that doesn’t have real plates or silverware. Portions were small: Schwarma dry, room temperature, and flavorless. Hummus itself is fine but nothing special. Pita is okay though. Otherwise it’s pretty dirty in there, they don’t change overflowing trash etc.\nThe most absurd part of the evening came when an elderly Israeli man entered and asked for a pita with hummus in it (which you could get in Israeli at any place like this). The cashier refused to sell one to him claiming it’s not on the menu, but a real humus place should offer this.\nEssentially this place lacks good food and the warm Israeli hospitality. Would never go back."
