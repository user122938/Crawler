Everything from the mainstays to the specials are delicious and made with heart. Their margaritas are also incredible. Highly recommend the mole. The service is always warm and friendly. Another plus is that the fun atmosphere could definitely warrant a more dressy date night, but many people also go completely casual and we have felt comfortable doing so as well. If there was only one restaurant I was able to recommend to a traveler to Brooklyn, it would be Chavela’s. Nothing compares!"

The food was real basic mexican food, because of the fame I was expecting a little more. I give the food a 5. We had chilaquiles, tostadas, huarache, esquites and Plato don. Dont have any of them maybe other plates are better. We also had bread pudding it was a 4. Music was good and our server great!"

            "text": "Not great for a few reasons!\n\nIf you pay attention, most (maybe all?) of their meats are stewed or pulled or are prepared so that when an order comes in, they can grab the premade meat, combine it with a tortilla or another vehicle, and turn the  ticket around quickly. This drives a huge lack in quality and in texture. Comparing it to other tacos in the neighborhood where proteins are cooked on a flat top during prep, it’s hard to compare.\n\nThe piece above also means most of your food is drippy or soggy. Again, a textureless and subpar experience.\n\nThis feels like a place that had its glory days some years ago and now just makes big batch proteins that they can quickly flip tables and make money.\n\nIt’s mid and expensive. Go to Guero’s or even Nacho Macho is a better pick for Mexican in the neighborhood."

As we walked in, this place immediately got a line out the door, it gets packed on the weekends!\n\nThe food was solid. The Plato don Carne was quite good, the chicken imo was better than the steak. The enchiladas mariscos was okay. The shrimp and crabmeat were good. Salmon was an odd choice for a filling. Mole was standard mole, nothing too insane. The pozole was one of the better pozoles I’ve had. The ceviche was fresh and delicious! Salsas were fine and the guacamole was fresh.\n\nOverall, I think I would come back and try some different stuff."

The Huevos Rancheros were inedible, and the tacos also tasted off. The best things were the guacamole & homemade tortilla chips, and the quesadillas, but even these were just okay, not great, just okay. Also, the food was overpriced for the area and what you get. Perhaps this place used to be better, or this was an off day. We’ve eaten much better Mexican food in the East Village, our neighborhood.\n\nOn our way out we noticed they have a “B” sanitary rating, this may explain part of the problem.

I read the reviews, and it was mentioned that “this is the best Mexican food in the city.”……I guess people don’t get out much.\nThe biggest disappointment was the churros; I was distraught. I am an eat dessert first kind of gal, but if I had eaten these churros first, I would have left right after. There was NO crunch, and the middle was oily and soft, two things that are big no-nos when we are talking about churros. I could have cried on the spot, and no, I’m not being dramatic; dessert is my thing. Check out my review before this one if uou want to try an amazing Mexican restaurant, they are my favorite, from start to finish! 🙌🏾\n\nAs for service, I felt rushed. When I put down my fork, they grabbed it IMMEDIATELY. I didn’t get the “hey stay have another drink vibe,” instead it’s been 30 minutes you had ONE drink and some food, byeeeee.\nIt's not the place where I want to have a pitcher of sangria and hang out. I won't be back."

It’s very lively & we were met w/ a short line & a 10 min wait time for a walk in(honestly great turnover rate).\n\nThe staff was super generous & flowed like water through the night; super attentive & helpful.

Nothing compares to real, genuine, authentic Mexican flavors. Chef Arturo certainly knows his roots and you taste it in the cuisine.\n\nI’d really like to talk about their chicken mole...girl....this is THEE chicken mole to try. If you’ve never had chicken mole, do yourself a favor and start with Chavela’s. They offer the standard for what chicken mole should be! First off, there’s literally chocolate in the sauce. I’ve had it at restaurants, where they overdo it with the chocolate. There should be a hint of it. You should know it’s there, but it should never be an overbearing note of chocolate. The mole sauce at Chavela’s is to die for! It’s rich and homey, and spews Mexican flavors! I mean, every time I get it, I eat it slowly, in order to enjoy the ride that it takes me on. Aside from the mole sauce itself, the chicken is always PERFECTLY cooked! So tender and never over cooked.\n\nI’d also like to make mention of their margaritas. There’s margaritas, then there’s real, authentic margaritas. That’s what Chavela’s offers. There are layers of flavor in their margs. They are always consistently delicious. And salt around the rim is a must! Their guacamole is house made, ALWAYS, and you taste it every time, in every bite. Nice, chunky, yet creamy, guacamole. It’s served with their house made tortillas!\n\nEverything I’ve ordered here, has been made with love. It’s an ingredient, and I say it all the time. When there’s love in a dish, I taste it right away. Much love to Chavela’s."

It's walk-in only but was fortunate to get a table at 6:15 because the place was full (on a Monday night) when we left. Alan, our server was wonderful and took great care of us. The spicy margarita was delicious and actually very spicy, which I appreciated. We absolutely loved the special short rib tacos and empanadas. So flavorful. We shared the Aurelia's mole and enjoyed the flavors but thought the chicken was a bit dry. That's the only slight criticism we had.

We had about 8 people in our party but didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes to get a table. The drinks were made just right (I had a strawberry margarita).\n\nThe food was exceptional! Definitely more of an adult dining experience though. We had 2 girls (10 years old) with us and they didn't seem too excited about anything on the menu. We ended up getting them french toast and quesadillas which they did enjoy.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Would def go back again."

My group sat inside. We order the corn & guacamole for appetizers. Both were absolutely delicious. For the main We ordered the Don Plato which comes with chicken and steak and my husband got the short ribs with mole sauce. Both did not disappoint. Definitely will be coming back for the excellent service and food. Drinks were also very good. I ordered the strawberry margarita."

The staff was fabulous, especially my sever Jorge. I ordered the chicken taco.  The services was fast eventhough I only ordered 1 Taco.  It was one of the fresh and delicious taco I have eaten. I was pressed for time and could not enjoy the atmosphere but will be going back.  I definitely recommend this place for a quick bite or a full course meal.  Enjoy.."

Make reservations!\n\nStaff was very friendly and helped us find things on the menu that we could eat. I am vegetarian. Waiter literally pulled up pictures of items on his phone to show us. Very amazing.\n\nQuick service and exclusive staff. We sat outside under a heater. Which turned out better than I thought. Very warm and cozy. Must go back and sit inside next time ."

One drop goes a long way. The specials are always on point. It's always lively but also feels intimate at the same time. Staff is friendly and on point with service.  Food is always at the appropriate temp. Drinks are amazing."

The decor is fantastic, bright colors and artifacts, a beautiful bar. I had the tortilla soup (delicious and so, so spicy for me!) a tamale and the mole and fish tacos. All were delicious, the tacos were definitely the stand out. Would recommend both the mole and pescado, I want to go back to try more. I didn’t feel rushed or hurried out. A great dining experience."

Our server was so friendly and thoughtful and our food came out super quickly! The bottle of sangria was a great deal and we all loved our food. My favorites were the smoked trout guacamole and Aurelia's mole which had such subtle flavors. Will definitely be back!"
