Their service was amazing also because of they speak to you in a gentle tone. And we CANNOT forget that they are a hero for saving that couple life. The food was pretty good it had flavor even though most take out places I been to lacked flavor because it got cold but when I ordered take out the food was not only flavorful but it was hot. And I don’t really like pizza but this store pizza was DELICIOUS I will definitely be coming back."

This man is a 5 star multi-tasker! We sat down and didn’t wait too long before it was hot and freshly ready. The first bite was scorching hot but we simply could not put it down! The flavor was exquisite! Crispy on bottom, soft on top, light and flavorful toppings. It looks so simple but the flavors packed a punch! We ended up ordering a couple more slices to try other things and all were amazingly delicious! Thanks for the great food! Props to the cooks and owner who keep this place hopping."

This is the first time since I came to the United States that I have had pizza that is not salty, not greasy, light and savory. The dough was moderately well cooked and crispy. To me, it was much more delicious than the pizzas that are said to be the top three pizzas in New York. Most customers ate pizza by the slice, and the whole pizza is a family size. Normally, one slice would be enough, but with this pizza, you can enjoy up to two slices. The ham as a topping is not salty and goes well with the cheese, so it doesn't drip with oil when you eat it with your hand. (Other places' pizzas dripped with oil as they cooled) It's light. Anyway. One-line summary. Trust me and try it. It's delicious. I think I'll be hooked for a while."
