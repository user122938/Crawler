The knockwurst was just a hot dog I was thinking it might be something more creative and for the price.

The portion sizes are also small, the smash burger is more of a smash slider size, not a full burger size. That said the flavors were great!"

My family and I made the trip, and let me tell you, it was worth it.\n\nWe started with the truffle fries, and they were excellent—crispy, flavorful, and a perfect way to kick off the meal. I had a smash burger, my son had a high-stack burger with a brioche bun, my daughters had chicken and waffles, and my wife had something with truffles. Every dish was executed perfectly. The chicken cutlet in the waffles? Not overcooked like so many places do—it was just right.\n\nNow, I expected a long wait. It’s New York, it’s busy, and I saw them cranking out Uber Eats, Seamless, and Grubhub orders. But somehow, the food came out shockingly fast, and our server was beyond attentive despite the crowd. You could tell they run a tight operation.\n\nBeing able to see into the kitchen, I assumed there had to be an army of chefs. But no—it was just a handful of them working with insane efficiency, and the quality never suffered. I was so impressed that I had to personally compliment the manager.\n\nA few notes for anyone coming here: Expect street parking battles—it’s Crown Heights, after all. Also, like many restaurants now, gratuity is built into the POS system, so check before tipping extra. And most importantly, this isn’t just a “kids' place.” Yes, you’ll see big families from all over the world, but that’s part of the experience—hearing the different languages, feeling the energy.\n\nAs someone who’s been eating at restaurants my whole life, I don’t throw around five-star reviews lightly. I write about my real experiences—good or bad. But this place? It’s an easy five stars. The food, the service, the experience—it’s all there.\n\nWould I go back? Without question. We’d make the trip just for this spot. Highly recommend!"

This almost feels like a fast food or sport stadium burger. The smash burgers are tiny, but also not rightly smashed, because there is no crunch from the smash burger. It also is missing your freshness you're looking for in a summer menu, e.g add a tomato or something else. Also don't take out the caramelized onions from it. All in all, I still highly recommend b&b, just not their smash burgers.\n\nOriginal review:\nI've been a regular at Boeuf & Bun for a while now, and every visit has been consistently outstanding. This place truly deserves a solid 5-star review. The burgers are hands down the best I've ever had, and they never disappoint. But it's not just the burgers that keep me coming back; it's the entire experience.\n\nTheir selection of dips is incredible, and the beer choices are always on point. During my recent visit, we decided to indulge in their chicken wings, flatbread, and fries with that delectable truffle topping. And let me tell you, it was a flavor explosion! The onion rings were exceptionally light and airy, and the chicken nuggets were a delightful addition to our meal.\n\nNow, here's the secret weapon – the deep fried Oreos. You absolutely can't leave without trying them! The jam sauce drizzled on top of the ice cream is pure perfection and adds that sweet finishing touch to a fantastic meal.\n\nBoeuf & Bun is the go-to spot for burger enthusiasts and food lovers alike. The combination of superb burgers, delectable sides, and that sweet ending with deep fried Oreos keeps me coming back for more. This place consistently hits the mark, making it a 5-star gem in the world of burger joints!"

            "text": "Wow! Amazing food and beautiful atmosphere! Highly recommend.\n\nWe ordered the Rib Eye Tartare, Truffle Fries, New Yorker Burger, and the Baah Baah Burger. The tartare was very soft and smooth, and paired very well with the crunchy bread slices, egg yolk, and sauce. If you get it, I recommend eating everything in one bite. The truffles fries were some of the best fried I’ve ever had! Nice and crispy on the outside with a nice, soft and hot inside! They were clearly flash fried in very hot oil. Well seasoned with salt and garlic. We asked for some horseradish mayo on the side and that was an incredible addition.\n\nThe burgers were also incredible. Although in pictures it appears as if the burgers come with too much bun, this couldn’t be further from the truth! The bun was not overpowering at all. The New Yorker packed an acidic punch that paired well with the smoky flavor of the pastrami and the juicy richness of the burger. The Baah Baah Burger was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor of lamb. Sometimes lamb burgers have off or weird flavors, but the taste of this one was actually reminiscent of lamb chops. It was served with a cumin sauce which complemented the lamb and added complexity to the burger.\n\nThe ambience was also great. The restaurant is lit warmly to complement its beautifully polished wooden tables and chairs. The dishes were presented fabulously (especially the tartare).\n\nOverall 5/5! If you want a good burger and a nice experience please give Boeuf and Bun a try, you won’t regret it!"

Every burger is $20+, a la carte. We ordered two burgers. One burger was decent, but the patty of the other burger was burnt beyond what's edible - I ended up canceling it as we were not having a good experience. The first server we had was somewhat rude and inattentive, despite the place being nearly completely empty. The other server was better, and a runner from the kitchen seemed nice. I first thought the automatic gratuity was a little strange (it applies to anyone, regardless of party size), but I realized it might be because many customers weren't tipping at all. So, I understand that, although others have complained."
