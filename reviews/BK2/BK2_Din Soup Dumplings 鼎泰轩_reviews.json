The soup dumplings were perfectly made: thin, delicate wrappers with rich, flavorful broth inside that burst with every bite. You can tell they care about freshness and technique.\n\nThe staff were friendly, attentive, and quick to check in without hovering. The atmosphere is cozy but still feels modern, great for both casual lunches and date nights."

The xiaolongbao are a highlight: thin, translucent wrappers encasing piping-hot, savory broth and tender filling that explode with umami in every bite. Service is equally impressive; the staff are warm, attentive, and genuinely caring, offering thoughtful recommendations and ensuring every need is met with a smile. From start to finish, dining here feels like a treat—delicious, welcoming, and unforgettable!"

I will be calling this place for a refund, if not my bank will refund the extra money ($4)."

When we tried to get the waiters attention, they were unresponsive. I also had requested a seat in the back and they refused since we were only 2 people. 5minutes later a party of 2 walked in and were given the same table I requested. After reading other reviews, it seems this is common! I prefer to go places were customers are VALUED."

This place is definitely not my flavor.\n\nI came in here because Lichi Nut wasn't able to process credit card payments at the time.\n\nI ordered the passion fruit green tea, peanut sauce noodles with fried chicken, scallion pancakes and the pork steamed buns.\n\nMinus the passion fruit green tea, everything else was disappointing. The peanut sauce noodles were bland, like the peanuts were diluted with oil. The chicken was clumpy and all stuck together kind of like candy corn that's been sitting in the bowl for 6 months. The scallion pancakes were undercooked and almost runny. The pork steamed buns were mid, but the sauce was off putting. It was sweet. Normally steamed bun places serve their sauce as black vinegar with sliced ginger.\n\nWhen i was waiting for the steamed buns, one of the workers came up to me and said \"WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING ELSE?\" Yes, I would like the last of my order. I felt like I was getting rushed out of there.\n\nThis place is NOT IT. Will not be returning."

The service is lovely and they even have a loyalty card! I bring every single person who visits here cause it’s just simply the best, and they all agree with me. I highly recommend all soup dumplings, shumai, all handmade steamed or fried dumplings (love the cod!!) and the pork in lotus leaf!! Thank you 🩷🩷🩷"

            "text": "The BEST pan-fried pork buns at an underrated gem in Brooklyn Heights. If you like your SJB with a thinner wrapper and a crispy bottom, this is the spot.\n\nI admit I was super skeptical when my family suggested it—the restaurant’s Chinese name is clearly trying to imitate Din Tai Fung lol. Plus, the menu is a mash-up of Shanghainese, Szechuanese, and Cantonese dishes, which usually screams \"inauthentic\".\n\nBut I was so wrong. Their soup dumplings and pan-fried pork buns were mind-blowing, all freshly made in an open kitchen. Even the dessert blew me away.\n\nIf you can’t snag a reservation at Din Tai Fung, check out Din Soup Dumpling instead. It’s more affordable and just as satisfying.\n\n＊Pan Fried Pork Bun 生煎包 $9/4pc, $12/6pc\nI’m not exaggerating when I say this is the BEST sheng jian bao in NYC. It's hard to find SJB with a thin wrapper, even when I was in Hong Kong. Each bun was packed with rich meat juice and wrapped in a thin, chewy skin. They were so good that we had to order another round🤤\n\n＊Crab Meat & Pork Soup Dumpling 蟹粉小籠包 $12\nThese crab and pork xiaolongbao were juicy, and meaty. The dumpling wrapper was thin, making them less doughy than those at many other places.\n\n＊Shrimp Stir Fried Thick Noodle 上海粗炒 $14.25\nThe shrimp was bouncy and fresh, but the noodles and overall flavor were just okay. Not particularly memorable.\n\n＊House Vegetable Bun 素菜包 $7.5/2pcs\nMy relatives raved about these veggie buns, but I didn’t quite get it. The steamed buns were soft and fluffy, but the filling lacked flavor imo.\n\n＊Sweet Osmanthus Rice Cake 桂花拉糕 $6\nNext time, I’m saving more room for these! Infused with osmanthus syrup, the rice cakes were chewy and mochi-like. They were smaller than expected, but every bite was light and satisfying.\n\n＊Peanut & Brown Sugar Mochi 紅糖麻糍 $7\nSkippable. I wasn’t a fan of the crumbly, nutty filling, and the \"mochi\" wasn't really mochi. It was more like a thin, pan-fried dough rolled up."

            "text": "This restaurant was coincidentally, found by ChatGPT when I was craving for some soup dumpling restaurants. I asked ChatGPT to do some deep dive research and find me a restaurant in Brooklyn, where it was convenient for me to go after work. And had very delicious and most authentic soup dumplings in the area. Because I don’t know about you there are many times. I have not enjoyed a soup, dump, and Restaurant due to a thick skin, and the feelings were not good enough. Honestly this place has a great amount of feeling and especially the crab soup dumpling was amazing even the skin for the soup dumpling. It was perfect. I enjoyed the small pan fried dumplings as well along with a drink. It was very very delicious and I enjoyed it every single time I look forward to coming to this place more, along with my family and friends."

First impressions are everything and as soon as you walk in everything is nice and clean. The tables are perfectly spaced out and the place is large enough to accommodate walk-ins and not be overbearing. The food was great! We had the vegetable dumplings, spicy tofu, spring rolls, cucumber salad and the pork dumplings in peanut sauce. BOMB! Left absolutely stuffed and satisfied. The pricing is fair, you may be like me and think “only 6dumplings” but trust me, it’s enough. You have the option to choose your dumplings steamed/fried/pan seared. Will be recommending this spot and bringing people here. Thank you for your hospitality as well!"

We ordered the pickle chili chicken dumplings, beef pan-fried dumplings, lamb ramen, seafood shumai dumplings, and sesame balls. Every single dish was packed with flavor. Not a single leftover was left behind.\n\nThe service was just as impressive as the food. Our waiter, Steven (hope I got the spelling right), was fantastic, polite, and welcoming. He made the whole experience even better.\n\nThis spot is a gem, and I’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommend if you’re looking for great food and top-notch service!"

Very reasonable prices $15 Dollars for a chicken broth rice noodle soup with brisket and it was such a nice soup!\nAlso 5% discount of you pay cash.\nThumbs up!"

Surprisingly, this place has very good dumplings. 🥟 The quality is great and the craft of them was very artistic. The mushroom baos actually look like giant dumplings the way they charred the dough. Very creative. The scallion burrito style wraps with beef were incredible. Overall you can’t go wrong with any of the dishes. The price is pricey but the quality is very high. Highly recommend ✨"

Acqua, bel piatto di noodles e decina di nuggets fritti a 11 dollari più solita tassa obbligata scegliendo dal menù lunch.

I got spicy stir fried veggie noodles and the serving size was perfect to fill me up and have leftovers for linch the next day :)"

We live local and the place is an unexpected local gem. We had two kids and a parent with us, who is vegetarian. The menu has a wide range of choices to please everyone. The service, ambiance, and food quality is first class. We plan on coming back again. Thank you."
