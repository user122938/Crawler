The service John El.. or Johnny (not sure which his actual name is) made pretty great drinks but he wasnt very attentive and after i didnt finish my food he insisted upon packing it to go (i normally always pack my own food to go) but he explained thatbit was company policy. I get home and he literally shaved my whole plate into a box and I wouldnt even feed this to my dog. Im dissapointed cause the food was very good and I even told a few friends to come back but his service is HORRIBLE and deeply disappointed. Not to mention his AUTOMATIC GRATUITY was almost $100 which isnt a probpem but he didnt deserve $50… i will not be coming back to this establishment solely based off him."

The food is overpriced for no reason, the drinks need some work, and the coconut dessert tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge uncovered. Gratuity is included so be prepared for slow service. The best part of this place was the ambiance. Honestly I’d rather go to a hole in the wall Asian spot than spend 300 plus on basic food."

            "text": "The food was generally good, but prices felt more like the West Village than Bushwick. Portions of wine were tiny for nearly $20 a glass, and they added auto-gratuity for a table of three, which felt insulting. Service was okay but pushy on upsells, and drinks came out awkwardly spaced—one at a time over several minutes. Inside is nicely done, but the loud rap music makes it feel more like a club than a restaurant. Overall, decent experience — maybe worth getting takeout from instead."

The food was flavorful and beautifully presented-every dish had that perfect Asian-fusion balance of comfort and creativity.\n\nThe ambiance is where this place really shines. The lighting is warm and moody, giving it that intimate, modern-lounge feel without being too dark. The brick accent wall, emerald-green booths, and gold fixtures make the space feel cozy yet upscale-perfect for date nights or small gatherings.\n\nOur waiter Jonathan was excellent, attentive, kind, and made us feel welcome from the moment we sat down. Service really can make or break a dining experience, and he nailed it.\n\nMy only wish is that the cocktail list was a bit more extensive, because the drink I had was okay, and I would’ve loved to explore more options. The wine list was impressive I’ll admit, but I wasn’t in the mood for wine lol\n\nOverall, it was a beautiful night-great food, beautiful setting, and wonderful company. I’ll definitely be back!"

Drinks were okay, tasty and not strong.\n\nFor all these dishes and two drinks, party of two, the bill came out to $190."

If there’s a table open for us (for literally 90 minutes) then why tell us you’re res only? It just comes off as rude and unnecessary especially coming from someone in sweatpants. Benefit of the doubt, maybe mgmt tells them to say it in which case mgmt do better. Our server was great and the food was really good and we probably would have stayed longer and tried more on the menu had we not been put off by the entry. For reference la cantine down the street was fully reserved and perfectly polite about it and we thanked them and left. It isn’t hard."

The taste of the food was not worth the price on the menu. We got the Black Pepper Steak (4/5), Crispy Garlic Fried Chicken (2/5) and Roasted Duck-Fat Fried Rice (2/5)\n\nThe black pepper steak was pretty flavorful, the Crispy Garlic Fried chicken had a crispy outer layer (like the name says) but flavor ?? Im not too sure what happened with that and the Roasted Duck-Fat Fried Rice taste like regular fried rice (so I’m confused by the name)\n\nWouldn’t go back again but I do recommend Brooklyn Chop House and Philippe Chow …"

Which I can understand and didn't bother me too much. But the rules about the bar are kind of weird. And makes it awkward for the hostess. Anyways. I walked in tonight, Saturday and just asked to sit at the bar, was told now it's \"reservation only\" then I mentioned I didn't know and hostess was just pretty rude to be frank. It's upsetting. Eventually when a place gets too many rules it starts to feel inaccessible, and that's what's happening here. I have stood up for this place on TikTok, etc so it just sucks to not be greeted too kind. Almost like how dare me walk in on a Saturday to ask for a seat lol. Anyways I left. May not be back again unfortunately.  Leaving 3 stars bc I love the food and moreso sharing for feedback to management as I've seen this place change since opening"

            "text": "Extremely disappointing experience. I arrived 10 minutes late to my best friend’s birthday dinner, where the restaurant had already seated a table of 9 with a fixed menu. I completely understood that we couldn’t be added to the check, so I asked if my husband and I could sit at the empty table right next to the group and order separately.\n\nThe waitress was extremely rude and dismissive, saying it was “against policy” with no effort to explain or offer alternatives, despite the restaurant being almost completely empty and it raining outside. The only option she gave was to sit at the bar, facing our friends’ table, which made no sense and felt unnecessarily inflexible.\n\nIn the end, we had no choice but to leave. The whole interaction made us feel unwelcome and created an awkward, avoidable situation for us and the rest of the party. I understand the policy around the fixed menu, and yes, I was late, but I traveled a long way in bad weather to be there. A little empathy and basic respect would’ve gone a long way. Really disappointed with both the service and the attitude."

She deserves the 20% automatic gratuity added to your bill.  The ambiance was cozy and nice, with no complaints there. As for the food, we could've gone to the Chinese buffet, and the food would've tasted better.  The food lacked seasoning. The only things that tasted good were the dipping sauces.  Also the entrees don't come with sides so it's more al a carte style. Spent $378.00 for a party of 4. We could've gone to Brooklyn Crab House instead."

While being greeted by the oh so kind hostess, you are given a moment to truly embrace the aura of the space. Your eyes first gravitates to the immersive semi sunken bar surrounded by blissful golden barstools illuminated by soft light. As the hostess carefully walks you to your seat, you begin to feel the opulence of the decor melting away the stress of your day.\nThe journey truly begins once you scan the restaurant menu. There you will find an array of beautifully thought out cocktails, wines, and dishes that truly awakens one’s curiosity.\nTo begin our journey, my cousin and I thoroughly enjoyed the Char Siu and Scallion Pancakes to wet our palettes. Hannah, our server, patiently guided us through the cocktail options making superb recommendations. Our first round of cocktails included the Serpent’s Tale and the Immortal Peach. We then drooled over the Cumin Lamb Ribs and Roasted Duck- Fat Fried Rice. All dishes bringing us to euphoria. To close out, we ordered another round of cocktails that included the Heartbeet and Pandan Express. The cocktails were so incredible that I literally got out my seat and walked to our bartender, Thieanna, to give her applause.\nWhich, by the way she accepted with such humility. The craftsmanship of those cocktails surely deserves a spot on the 50 Best Bars in the World. And as someone who has been to five bars on the list within the last four months, the compliment comes with ease because they definitely belong on that list.\nI want to express my gratitude to Thieanna, Hannah, Thom, De Cory, and Nana for such a superb dining experience. Little did they know that the warm service along with the outstanding meal helped me to kick the depression that was knocking at my door that day. So thanks Monkey King for a memorable journey. I will definitely see you again soon!"

The host was extremely accommodating and made us feel welcomed even though the environment was curated more for an adult dining experience. The dishes were designed for family style groups so bring your family and friends for sure. Let’s start with the cocktails where my wife enjoyed The Monkey King and I indulged in the Evening Harvest. Both were well crafted & balanced cocktails which left me speechless. I’m a mixologist and I was pleasantly surprised by the intentionality and craftsmanship of both these masterpieces. We ordered 2-3 small plates and each one was better than the next. For entrees we ordered the Cumin Lamb Ribs, Duck Fat Fried Rice and the String Beans… Superb!!! This is a DEFINITE must try restaurant. You won’t be disappointed for damn sure."

I also don’t mind a digital menu but this one is hard to navigate and also was missing the cocktail menu and nobody brought us that menu.

Paid cash because upon receiving the bill was made aware there would be an additional 3% for credit card which should be disclosed beforehand. The char sui pork was tender but lacked the traditional BBQ flavor. The Ginger, scallion lobster was cooked perfectly but lacked any ginger flavor at all. The crab fried rice was flavorless and the rice seemed like it was scraped from the bottom of the pot. It was dry and hard. The sautéed bok choy was also flavorless and soggy. The shrimp dumplings were good. The scallops were okay but the one I had tasted of iodine. The portions were surprisingly small. The cocktails were lackluster served in the smallest glasses I've ever seen. The attire of the servers was unacceptable for the pricepoint of the menu. It looked like they had just come from the laundromat straight to work.We went there for an experience and left underwhelmed. For $400, for a party of 3, there is a lot that needs to improve."

            "text": "Our family took an hour and half trip to this restaurant since it was promoted as a Bengali Chinese fusion place. We made reservation in advance to ensure our spot. Upon arrival we were seated in our table within minutes. The place appeared modern and slick, cool dining tables and a dining bar that is little below the restaurant floor. But I found the restaurant’s ambiance too dark, it was hard to see anything around the restaurant. The iPhone taking all the pictures in night mode, that’s how dark it was.\n\nThe menu was via QR code but the restaurant had no reception for Verizon. I asked them for wifi and they gave me one that had network problems. So I had to walk outside multiple times to load the menu. Once I read thru the menu I was disappointed to see it was full of regular Chinese appetizers and entrees, nothing Bengali about any of them.\n\nWe ordered whole bunch of items, starting with the soup dumplings. The soup dumplings barely had any soup, I counter, about five drops came of each dumpling. Shrimp shau mai and pearl dumplings both were basic. The vegetable dishes like pickled cucumbers, eggplant with garlic sauce and boiled bok choy were actually far better good dishes. Chicken wings were also good. The best dish of the night was the lamb ribs. They were soft, juicy, tender, had amazing taste. But it took them an hour to bring the dish out. We finished all our other food, and then waited 10-15 minutes more to finally see the lamb dish arrive at our table.\n\nThe service was pretty good. Our server was very polite and friendly. The staff cordially greeted me for father’s day. Although the dinner was fine, I felt like for the price we paid the dishes could have been far better quality and quantity. I had eaten most of these dishes in other Chinese restaurants for half the price."

I didnt care for the fact that they don't serve any of the steamed dumplings during the week, only on the weekends. The Pan Fried Chicken Dumplings,were ok. The whole filling on the inside kept falling out with every bite. The Fried Shrimp Toast was definitely an acquired taste, its not for me. The Char Sui and Marinated Sichuan Cucumbers were soooooo good! 10/10 definitely recommend. The Beef Chow Fun was also good. The staff was polite and attentive. Each plate is sharable. You can with 2-3 people and be full off of what we ordered. The total bill was $200, which is kinda expensive considering 4 of the 5 items ordered were appetizers. Oveall I will visit again for my favorites and to try their dumplings."

Late trains put us there 35m before show time…no way I thought. Let the hostess know, would have been totally reasonable to just cancel us. They got us seated and fed in remarkable fashion and with remarkable care and out the door to our show in perfect time. Absolutely blown away by their care and attention. Not to mention the food we scarfed down was absolutely amazing. I really hope I can go back someday to enjoy it more. Thank you again to all of the staff.

The staff are very nice and friendly. Attentive through out the service.\n\nOnce you enter, you see the bar area in a lower ground which is cool. After-hour vibes, dimmed light, comfortable seats.\n\nThe food is mediocre. They advertise as Chinese-Bengali fusion but there’s no Bengali food expect for one dessert. Very basic for all the dishes. Small portion even though they say it’s “sharing” style. Nothing comes with rice. The only dish I like it’s chicken wings, tender and wrapped with flavors.\n\nAlso I can smell weed from our table. Nothing against people who smoke but I really hate that smell."

But the reason I'm going for 3 stars is because of the fact that Auto-gratuity was added into a table of 2. In the industry is a well known practice for tables of 6+ people or events. But never for a 2 pax one. On top of that the server didn't mention it, so if you don't check closely you'll ended up over tipping, which isnt the problem. Is the the whole action what matters to me. This plus the $50 fee for reservation cancellation is definitely a turn off. Is Bushwick, not Manhattan. And on the atmosphere side, honestly I don't want to be listening to Hip-Hop/Rap while I'm having dinner. Honest review, I'll keep recommending the food since it's amazing no doubt, but that's my take. Cheers!!"

Unfortunately, it was underwhelming — we found it lacking in both salt and chili oil flavor, making it feel quite flat. We requested chili oil twice, but it wasn’t brought over until we asked a third time, which impacted the flow of the meal.\n\nThe chicken dumplings were the highlight of our dinner — well-prepared and flavorful. We truly enjoyed them.\n\nThe garlic fried chicken came out surprisingly early, before the fried rice or lamb ribs, even though we were told the mains would be served together. As a result, the chicken sat and got cold while we waited. We had to ask twice about the rice before it was finally brought out, followed by the lamb — but by that time, the chicken was no longer hot.\n\nThe duck fat fried rice was fresh and hot, but lacked basic seasoning — a bit more salt would’ve made a noticeable difference. As for the lamb ribs, they were overwhelmingly fatty with very little actual meat, which made them disappointing.\n\nWe think the restaurant has potential, but unfortunately this experience missed the mark in both flavor and service flow."

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with an open space with some seating, a sleek bar, and then the restaurant seating in the back. Service here was overall pretty quick and nice. The biggest thing that I wanted to note though was that they are pretty strict on their 90 minute dining limit, which I wasn't a fan of. As we went on a weekday where there were visibly many open seats, and to be constantly told or reminded of the dining limit felt abrasive and made us feel rushed. If we were given the option to move to the bar or something (ie. if they needed the table for another reservation), then it may have made sense.\n\nIf we were to solely talk about the food then I would say that it was great. We got the cucumber salad, the peking duck, and the beef chow fun. Everything was delicious and I would have been able to finish each of those by myself (maybe not at the same time though haha). Portions were good, and I would definitely recommend each of these dishes. Overall, although the food was good, I just think that the experience itself was really subpar (to be rushed) and for that reason alone, I don't think I would return (ie. you can find great dishes like these with a better dining experience)."

            "text": "It’s only fitting that the most delightful and memorable dining experience I’ve had came at a restaurant named after my favorite childhood hero.\n\nAs a first generation immigrant from China who grew up on authentic Asian cuisine, I’ve always been wary of dining in “Asian fusion” restaurants. Oftentimes in my experience “Asian fusion” was synonym with unnecessarily experimental — Often sullying classical dishes with perplexingly additives and ingredients.\n\nThe Monkey King is evolutionary — paying homage to the traditional cuisine, I’ve grown to love while allowing room for the diverse palette found in NYC to serve as inspiration for change. There wasn’t a dish that I felt was changed just for the sake of change.\n\nI had the privilege of being seated in the kitchen for a private chef’s tasting. Delicious food aside it was so novel to be dining behind closed doors. We were treated like VIPs and it felt truly exclusive. I’ve never experienced something like this before and I hope it’s not the last.\n\nThe tasting consisted of 4 small plates and 6 entrees. Highlights for me are:\n1. The Chicken Dumplings, which was seared to perfection. The cinnamon red oil not only gave this dish a unique flare but enhanced the flavor that made every bite leaving me wanting more.\n2. The Shrimp Toast. I love the contrast from its crunchy outer shell to its juicy shrimp interior. It tasted familiar, yet I can’t point to a dish quite like this one. It’s as if they took a combination of dim sum dishes and married it to create this masterpiece.\n3. The Duck Fat Fried Rice. It’s delicious. I can truly say their fried rice has ruined all other fried rice for me. This is above and beyond any other friend rice variant for me.\n\nEvery dish that was brought to the table was superb. Words cannot do the dishes justice. Whether you are dining in or ordering takeout, I highly recommend you try them for yourself. I am confident you won’t be disappointed."

The ambience with the decor & lighting set up a perfect vibe for either an intimate date night or a friendly outing with your group.\n\nAll servers were super attentive and I never had trouble flagging anyone down to refill our glasses because the entire staff was on top of it, including making sure our table was cleared through the ongoing course of our meal.\n\nThe food was beyond delicious, it was like throwing a concert of your favorite band (but for my taste buds).\n\nWe had the Cumin Lamb, Lobster Lo-mein, string beans, & chicken dumplings.\n\nIt's hard to rate them because they're all so good but hands down my favorite was the lamb. I have no idea how the chef made this, but clearly the hands of angels/god and our server was involved lol!! The lamb was crispy on the outside and juicy/soft inside and covered in a honey drizzle that really complemented the flavor that was cooked in.\n\nI wish I could give a higher rating than 5 stars but Google doesn't have that feature yet.\n\nThank you Monkey King! Will be coming here a lot and telling everyone about it :)"

The vibes were perfect and I love the simplicity of the decor (sleek and precise).\n\nBtw I forget our waiters name but i must say he was a vibe and took very good care of us.\n\nThey indeed have a full bar but the drink menu is very miniature and unexciting if I'm being honest.\n\nNow to the food\n\nA few must haves and I mean MUST HAVE\n-Shrimp toast was absolutely wonderful. Crispy on the outside and melts in your mouth. PERFECTION.\n-Wok fried green beans were to die for and then they added rib meat...it was unexpectedly mind blowing.\n-Char Sui I wanted to lick the plate. The pickled veggies and ginger scallion sauce were the perfect accompaniment.\n\nA few Disappointments\n-Shelter Prawns weren't necessarily terrible but also could have been an e-mail. Dry, no flavor simply boring.\n-Orange Cardamon cake almost seemed as an after thought. It too was dry, maybe serve with a whipped cream, ice cream or all together throw away.\n\nAll together I really enjoyed mostly everything. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting  one of the owners and her telling us a little about the inspiration behind the concept etc. I'll be back to try more things for sure."

            "text": "Let me preface this by saying my review reflects my own tastes as an American-born Chinese (ABC) with an ABC palate.\n\nI visited \"The Monkey King\" last night after seeing its high Google Reviews. While the food was decent and the atmosphere pleaant, I cannot recommend it for the price. If you're looking for similar or better food at a lower cost, I'd suggest taking the subway to Chinatown instead.\n\nService & Ambiance\nWhen we sat down, we were immediately asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, which felt like an unnecessary upsell. Tap water was available, but it wasn’t offered upfront.\nThe tables were set with only forks and knives, which suggested that ABCs and other Asians aren't the restaurant's target diners (though, to be fair, I do have one cousin who doesn't know how to use chopsticks). We were asked if we wanted chopsticks and the ones provided were reversible -- an interesting but impractical design. Reversible chopsticks make it unclear which side has been used, making them more confusing than functional.\nWe dined around 9:30 PM. Service was noticeably slow, though the restaurant was busy. At the start, a staff member took our coats, but when we left, no one was at the reception, so I had to find and grab my own coat.\n\nThe Food\nWe ordered:\n- Char Siu\n- Soup Dumplings (pork & crab) (but only pork was available)\n-Beef Chow Fun\n- Roasted Duck-Fat Fried Rice\n- Crispy Garlic Fried Chicken\n\nThe Soup Dumplings came with small bowls instead of the usual Asian soup spoons, making them awkward to eat. We weren’t given an explanation for the bowls, and their ergonomics didn’t make sense. It seemed like an attempt to be stylish at the cost of practicality—form over function in a way that hurt the dining experience.\n\nThe Char Siu had good texture and flavor, but the addition of ginger-scallion felt off—it’s traditionally paired with Soy Sauce Chicken or Roast Duck, not Char Siu. This felt like a misinterpretation of Cantonese BBQ, as if someone unfamiliar with the cuisine saw ginger-scallion paired with roasted meats and assumed it belonged here. That said, as ABCs, my guest and I love ginger-scallion, so we still enjoyed it.\n\nThe Beef Chow Fun was okay. The ribeye used was a nice upgrade from the cheaper cuts in traditional versions, but I didn’t love the contrast between the soft noodles and the firmer steak texture. A more tender cut, such as tenderlion/filet mignon, might have worked better.\n\nThe Crispy Garlic Fried Chicken was the biggest disappointment. The chicken was overcooked and dry, and the large cuts made it difficult to eat. Traditional Cantonese fried chicken is usually chopped into smaller, manageable pieces, but this dish seemed to prioritize a Western-style presentation over ease of eating. It’s frustrating when restaurants sacrifice user experience just to make a dish look more refined.\n\nVerdict\nWhile The Monkey King offers a stylish setting and some creative takes on Chinese dishes, too many choices seemed driven by aesthetics rather than functionality. From the impractical soup dumpling bowls to the oversized, dry chicken pieces, the experience felt like it was designed to look good rather than to be enjoyable to eat. For the price, I’d recommend heading to Chinatown for better food with more thought put into the dining experience."

We didn't know this when we got the food but we realized later on that they actually gave us one less shumai in the dish💀. I also have to agree with the review above about the turmeric sauce not really complementing some of the dishes. I actually thought it paired pretty well with the shrimp toast but not so much with the shumai.\n\nThe atmosphere was so-so. Not so much of an elevated vibe compared to the food, as the place has loud music and almost a clubby atmosphere.\nWe absolutely loved our server though! Would consider returning."

            "text": "I've been to Win Son, Wen Wen, and Birds of a Feather--and griped about trekking to each and every one of them because I felt the food was mediocre, under-portioned and overpriced. Chinese food for white hipsters, blech!\n\nThe Monkey King, which is even farther for me than the other places, was worth the trek. Harvey Wong and Munzzy Uddin have found the magic formula for balancing all the elements that you need to make a modern Asian restaurant work: authentic flavors, creative dishes, inviting decor, and friendly service. Throw in a stellar cocktail menu that surpasses many of the artisanal speakeasy spots in Manhattan, and they're on their way to something great.\n\n- Char Siu: As authentic as the bare bones Hong Kong BBQ spots I grew up with, right down to the ginger-scallion dipping sauce that makes me want to cry tears of glory (and I hate scallions).\n\n- Fried Shrimp Toast: Okay, I might actually have teared up eating this. Do you know how hard it is to find shrimp toast? You almost never see it on Chinese/Asian menus, and when it's there, it usually sucks. Not so here. Get this. Drench yourself in the sauce. Thank me later.\n\n- Cumin Lamb Ribs: RIP Fu Run and their amazing giant rack of cumin ribs. This is no Fu Run, but it's a nice take. I could've used a tad more cumin and no mesquite honey drizzle, but the fall-off-the-bone quality of the lamb was top-notch.\n\n- Seasonal Market Greens (bok choy): Because we all need to eat vegetables. Huge portion--I did not regret this.\n\n- Roasted Duck-Fat Fried Rice: Fragrant and light. Those expecting a flavor bomb of duck don't understand what duck-fat fried rice means. There should be a hint of duck, that's it--this is a supporting dish, not the main player.\n\n- Orange Cardamom Olive Oil Cake: They source their desserts from a nearby bakery, so if that matters to you, maybe skip this. I liked it, but that's because I love orange and cardamom and olive oil cake.\n\nHarvey told us he's gunning for the World's 50 Best Bars, and I have to say that the cocktails here are much more impressive than some of the NYC spots that have actually made the list (ahem, Katana Kitten, ahem Dead Rabbit). For fresh, earthy flavor, try the Heartbeet. For complex beyond your wildest dreams (and the only use of gunpowder green tea I've ever seen!), try The Atelier if it's available. For lip-numbing zest, try the Malagarita--though if I were Harvey, I'd put a ton more Szechuan peppercorns.\n\nAnd to think, the food now is just their takeout menu!"

The monkey king vibes are great, with decor making you feel like you on a date, or meeting up with friends.\n\nThe food was amazing, with my favorite double garlic eggplant and fried sichuan oyster mushrooms both having tons of flavor that goes well with the duck fat fried rice. Seasoned veggies, and string beans were also a hit as well as the tri-color dumplings which I will admit were a bit pricey but worth it to get once. The black pepper steak was also great with tons of flavor.\n\nDrinks are under $20 and pretty good, worth a try, but the food is definitely the star of the show as it should be.\n\nThe dessert was okay, mango lassi cake didn’t really taste mango at all. It does rotate monthly, so hopefully get something better next time.\n\nBathroom was clean and staff were friendly.\n\nIdeal coming either way between 3-6 ppl works best for you to try what you’d like, since there is a requirement to do a tasting menu for larger parties so be warned.\n\nAlso the QR code menu just leads to the website landing page and not the dine in menu, which could be improved and reduce confusion going forward."

We started with the mouthwatering chicken which is served room temperature and tasted amazing, along with that we ordered the chicken dumpling, that taste really good! For me the must try’s are the cumin Lamb ribs, the crispy garlic fried chicken and the garlic eggplant with some jasmine rice is just heaven. The food tastes really good its got a good fusion with Chinese and Bengali flavors to it! The manager was kind enough to serve us string beans with beef rib eye that was on the house! We were fortunate enough to experience “Gambey” which basically means you take a  shot and put the glass upside down and make sure nothing drips from your shot glass when you do it. Overall an amazing experience, thanks to management and the owners for giving us an amazing experience! The bar will be live in December so I will definitely return to try their cocktails! I will recommend this place to everyone that loves and appreciates different food and culture."

The owners are completely amazing people and take pride in the work they are doing. The food is just truly amazing the Char Sui was sooooo amazing!!!! We Questioned the pan fried dumpling because of the sauce but when we actually got to try it we wanted more and more and more! I had the duck fat fried rice which was absolutely amazing. I just wish it had a little more duck in it but the flavors were on point! My boyfriend had the shrimp fried rice with pineapple being that I am allergic to pineapple I did not try it but my boyfriend was amazed by the flavors and wished I could have experienced it with him. The Garlic Fried Chicken was Some of the best chicken I have had in my life. You can tell it was brined for a few days and seasoned well. This is the definition of a successful restaurant in the making. Keep this up and they will be able to become a Michelin star for their amazing flavors and service. This is my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn!!!!!!"

I showed up around 6pm on a Saturday with no reservations  but luckily someone cancelled right as the host was telling me there were no more tables lol. Please learn from my mistakes and grab a resy if you're heading here for dinner!\n\nOnce seated I was greeted by my fabulous server Ava who shared that The Monkey King serves Asian-fusion food that is designed to be shared. She recommended ordering about 2-3 small plates and then a main dish to share. At the recommendation of the bartender I ended up ordering the sichuan mushrooms, the char siu pork, the beef chow fun, and then one of the specials- The Peking duck. The mushrooms and char siu pork ended up coming out first and both were great. The mushrooms were lightly battered and fried and had a lovely kick to them. The pork was well seasoned and cooked and came with some beautifully pickled veggies on the side. Next came the beef chow fun which was the highlight of the meal for me. The noodle dish was FULL of flavor and it took everything in me to keep eating it despite how full I was honestly starting to get ha. Lastly we were able to try the Peking duck which came with a side of cucumbers, green onions, orange hoisin sauce, and bao buns to make mini duck baos. Another huge hit which makes a lot of sense as The Monkey King is known for their duck! Overall a really high quality choice. A great place to go with family, friends, or a date :)"

They’re so thoughtful with the overall vibe of the restaurant—from the lights to furniture to glassware to plates and even the bathrooms (love me an establishment that offers Le Labo). Staff members and owners were all really nice, knowledgeable, and accommodating. I love how they described the concept of the restaurant and made us feel welcome. The sauces on every plate were incredibly flavorful—especially the cinnamon red oil-infused soy sauce!!! We honestly wanted to take them home in a to-go container. The Pan Fried Chicken Dumplings were juicy and memorable. The Crispy Garlic Fried Chicken was so tender, and I usually don’t like Cantonese style chicken—but they made it with a twist. Also loved the pea shoots. They packed a punch without being too salty and soggy. The off-menu items were fire too! I would def go again and try everything else on their menu. Can’t wait to see them flourish and gain all the buzz they deserve. 🥲"

I had the best dining experience I’ve had in a VERY long time (domestic and international) and I dine out and travel like every month.\n\nWe had reservations at 6:30pm on Friday night. We were greeted and seated immediately. I like the fact that they offer to check your coats. The ambiance is very chic and modern. The sunken bar is my favorite. They have nice comfy velvet chairs which they vacuum after each seatings. The lighting is just right and the music was a vibe. It was good mix of everything modern.\n\nService: Ava C was our server and she was great! She was very attentive and personable. She was very thorough explaining menu items, the current specials, and made some great recommendations. Both owners Munzy and Harvey stopped by our table to checkin and chat us up. This is honestly one of the things I love the most about TMK- they are very hands-on and is right there with their staff working and making sure everything is going well.\n\nDrinks: we had rounds of the malagarita (fun twist of a spicy margarita) and house spritz. Both were really good and strong! We also had the Hild Elbling Sekt Brut #52 and COS Rami 2021 from the wines complimentary of the owner Munzy.\n\nFood: talk about an explosion of culture fusion! I wanted to explore all new items I didn’t have the first time but didn’t wanna cheat my friend out of her experience so we went all in! We had the pan fried chicken dumplings, tea smoked BBQ ribs, fried shrimp toast, char siu, roasted duck fat fried rice from the regular menu and the crabcake shumai, XO scallops, and ginger scallion lobster lo mein from the specials. I kid you not when I say we did not have a single bad dish! Everything was amazing!! The flavors, the tenderness, the sauces- pure perfection! The only issue we had was finishing all the food we ordered lol.\n\nTMK is top tier! You get fine dining experience with personalized service, great food AND portions!

Our waiter was accommodating and made us feel like we were seating in VIP. We met the owner Mike. He was professional and was grateful for us traveling to  Brooklyn New York  to try his restaurant. The taste from each dish blew us away from the concocted herbs and spices. We will definitely return."

            "text": "A good friend of mine told me he had made reservations at The Monkey King and I agreed to show up because I'm rarely a no-show when it comes to food. I went in completely blind so I was not expecting to be seated in the kitchen and to be given an immense amount of attention and care from everyone at The Monkey King.\n\nThe food honestly speaks for itself. I can go on forever about it. The cha-siu, and I'm not kidding, tastes just as good if not better than the long-standing Cantonese BBQ joints in Chinatown. The flavors are further elevated by the ginger-scallion sauce they provide on the side and they somehow managed this without it tasting pretentious, if that makes sense.\n\nThe shrimp was beautifully breaded. It looked so crispy that I thought they fried it with the shell on, but of course they had the shrimp de-shelled, because why wouldn't they? The shrimp toast with curry dip was their Asian-influenced take on grilled cheese and tomato soup -- a great snack. The duck-fat fried rice was the perfect complement to the rest of the dishes. It added a whole new layer of decadence. The veggies were stir-fried and seasoned to perfection, you'd honestly have to taste them to believe it.\n\nWith all of that said though, my three favorite dishes were the chicken dumplings (these little guys exploded with flavor and juices), the cumin spare ribs with Mike's Hot Honey, and the Mouthwatering Chicken dish. I wish they were a bit closer to my residence, I would easily place delivery orders every other day.\n\nAll of the drinks prepared by Harvey hit the spot but the last one (served with the slice of orange shown in the photos) was on a different level. It's like an old fashioned, but with a bit of smokiness? For those who have had herbal tea (or wong lo kat in cantonese), it's like that, but with less sugar and alcoholic. I'm not sure if it'll make it onto the menu permanently (I sure hope so), but if it does, I'm ordering one with every meal at The Monkey King moving forward.\n\nIt was honestly a great time. Thanks TMK, Munzy and Harvey, and the team there that night!\n\nPS They found out it was my dad's birthday that night and ended up letting me go with two additional dishes on top of the ones I originally ordered to-go."
