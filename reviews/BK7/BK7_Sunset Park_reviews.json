Much prefer going to parks that aren't built around public schools since this one has a school inside the middle of it. It's also not exactly as spacious as some other parks (Prospect, Central, Inwood Hill) so I took off 1 star for that.\n\nIt is right next to Greenwood Cemetary which is also a plus (check out my review of Greenwood Cemetary in my profile!) overall NOT A PARK i'd keep going back to since i'm in Queens and the commute is already long enough but maybe it will be to some other people's taste more..."

It's very surreal & most people are blown away.\n\nYou can play nearly any kind of sport here.\n\nThere's also a swimming pool in the summer."

The glorious view of Manhattan is always a sight worth seeing, and the “sunset” in Sunset Park truly lives up to its name, its breathtaking. This park has it all. Surrounding the park are amazing food options and a strong sense of community that shines brightest in the afternoon but continues to shimmer into the night. No other park in the city has a community quite like Sunset Park. Whether you’re a tourist, a native, or anyone in between, I’d recommend this park to everyone."

Members of the Chinese community are out in their numbers seated on the benches, doing group dancing of many different forms on several of the paved open areas, dancing with swords on the groomed lawns.... This park boasts of a very attractively built playground with bars, slides, a sand pit and interactive stations. There are also full-sized swings for kids of all ages. You may see community members grouped together to clean the park. You can find several people walking their dogs, playing sports on the court or on the grassy area. There is an Olympic sized pool that is of course a summer favourite. The park is one of the sites for city parks free summer sports camp for kids."

Tiene de todo: una gran vista de Manhattan y la Estatua de la Libertad, espacios amplios para caminar, hacer ejercicio o simplemente relajarse.\n\nEl parque es muy familiar, ideal para venir con los niños, hacer un picnic o pasar el rato bajo la sombra de los árboles. También tiene una piscina pública al aire libre (que abre en verano), canchas deportivas, zonas infantiles, y muchas bancas donde uno se puede sentar a ver el atardecer —de ahí su nombre, y con toda razón.\n\nLo que más me gusta es la sensación de comunidad. Gente jugando ajedrez, otros haciendo yoga, niños corriendo y familias disfrutando el aire libre. Todo eso hace que el parque tenga vida y buena energía.\n\nAdemás, el área está bien mantenida, limpia y con buena iluminación. Es perfecto tanto para hacer ejercicio temprano como para dar una caminata tranquila al final del día.\n\nSi estás en Brooklyn y no conoces Sunset Park, te estás perdiendo de una de las vistas más espectaculares de toda la ciudad. ¡Totalmente recomendado!"
