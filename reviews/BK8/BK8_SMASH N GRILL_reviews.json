I got the fried chicken and it didn't have much flavor - you can see the chicken is still pale yellow (comparatively to seasoned fried chicken/fried long enough chicken). Although looking at the burger again, the patties seem larger than the ones at either of the first two places I mentioned if you're looking for quantity."

            "text": "I highly recommend Smash and Grill! Their chicken over rice comes in a very generous portion, and it even includes fries on the side. The salad is super fresh and refreshing. The staff are friendly and welcoming, which makes the whole experience even better. Definitely a spot I’ll be coming back to!\n\n- Updates -\n\nI’ve been a regular customer ( placed at least 20+ orders since they open), but I’m honestly disappointed with my recent order. The price stayed the same, but the portion size has clearly decreased — at least 30% less compared to what I usually receive. I really should’ve taken a photo to show the difference because if you compare it with other customers’ past review photos, you can clearly see the change.\n\nIf this continues, I won’t be returning. At this point, even the halal food cart on 50th Street in Manhattan offers better consistency and value."

My mom ordered the traditional 6 pc BBQ wings.  I appreciate that they did not mince the lamb (cuts were nice and juicy) so that was a plus. Their portions are full of love and well as the food lol. My partner and mom enjoyed their meal also. For dessert we got the strawberry cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake ice cream, carrot cake and a black and white milkshake. The cheesecake ice cream was everything I needed. Definitely going back to try something new. Nasir at the counter has top tier customer service!"

The interior is very similar - bright lights, no seating, simple menu. Smash-n-Grill is a bit bigger inside and has more room for guests to wait.\n\nThe menu is easy to read. But I think where this place is different is the smash burger and the ice cream offerings. I didn't try either of them because I wanted to compare the fried chicken sandwich to The Munchies. Similar in price, we got the fried chicken hero combo. It took a while to get the order, but it is expected at a new establishment. It also didn't matter because it was delicious. The chicken was juicy and seasoned well. The amount of fries are the same, but I found these to stay crunchier than The Munchies.\n\nThis place is closer to me (not by much) so I'll be trying more when I'm feeling like eating some fresh, yummy food.\n\nThe customer service was also great! Welcome to the neighborhood Smash-N-Grill!\n\nCASH DISCOUNT TOO!"
