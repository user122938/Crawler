We ordered a variety of dishes including keema palata, nan gyi thoke, dum pot, tofu thoke, ohno kaukswe, laphet thoke, faluda, and mont lat saung.\n\nOverall, I'd give the meal four stars. While the flavors brought back nostalgic memories, the packaging could have been improved—some of the oil from the tofu thoke and laphet thoke leaked into the bag. We were also disappointed with the faluda, which lacked flavor, and the mont lat saung, which was overly sweet and thick. Additionally, we wished monhinga had been available on the menu.\n\nDespite some drawbacks, the meal was a special treat, and it was wonderful to enjoy the flavors of home again."

It's so good I'm writing this review at the table just as I finished the palata, potato curry, noddles and tea leaf salad. It is unexpectedly excellent and god-tier level gourmet for a mall food court, so much that it deserves to be its own sit-in restaurant. I was not in a mood for mall fast food at all, and this place served up subtle, spicy goodness that hit the spot perfectly. This is probably what home cooking tastes like if I had a Burmese mother, but I don't know, and can't compare it to other Burmese places because this was my first, but the food is good as is, regardless of what cuisine it is. It's as if a Halal truck ran over a beautiful menagerie of Southeast Asian cuisines and reincarnated into this place. It still feels like the best kept secret, since it's in the back corner of the food court, but I surely hope more people will discover it."

We got tea leaf salad and 2 noodle dishes (sorry, not good with names). You can ask them to adjust the spice depending on your tolerance. All the dishes were so flavorful and packs a punch. It's like a flavor bomb in your mouth. The tea leaf salad was my favorite. Loved how refreshing it was.  It was crunchy and full of texture. Really helps cut away the grease and helps with how heavy the other dishes are."

Their Ohno Kaukswe, a hearty chicken noodle soup brimming with complex flavors, is a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy and delight."

The low prices, short wait, fresh ingredients, and friendly owners make this place absolutely fantastic. The menu is streamlined and simple, and offers all kinds of great Burmese foods. I ordered the Ohno Kaukswe (Burmese Coconut Ramen/အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ) and was extremely happy with my choice. The cilantro and onion that garnished the broth and noodles were very fresh, and the coconut-based broth was so comforting. Such a great dish to have on a cold day. My friend got the Keema Palata—it was crispy and very well seasoned. The chicken curry roti was great as well, but above all, I would recommend the Ohno Kaukswe. Absolutely give this place a try.

The service was quick (took less than 7 min) and thoughtful. It’s the only time I’ve ever been given friendly instructions on how to serve and plate my food from a food court!\n\nWe came home and put the salad together according to the instructions we were given. The tea leaf salad was just as delicious as I remember from the Knight market and other Burmese restaurants I’ve been to that I’ve enjoyed. A salad is layered with so many different textures and flavors and spices that it’s just like a dance with every crunch in your mouth. I also am shocked at how cheap everything is on this menu. Please go here and give them some business because we definitely need to spread the love of delicious Burmese food."

Located in the Queens Mall food court, the Nan Gyi Toke (Burmese Udon Noodles salad with chicken) truly impressed me with its authentic flavors. The Shan noodles salad, however, didn't quite align with my taste preferences. They cooked with Halal meat. Nevertheless, I'm excited to return and explore more dishes from their menu.
