The same wonderful ladies are still running this authentic Italian deli, keeping the tradition and charm alive. If you're looking for true Italian food and products, this is *the* place to be.\n\nI ordered the Mama's Special, a perfect combination of Prosciuttini, Salami, and Mozzarella with Mushrooms and Peppers. It was as amazing as I remembered—packed with flavor and made with the freshest ingredients. Every bite took me back to why this deli has stood the test of time.\n\nLeo’s Latticini is not just a deli, it's an institution. Whether you're a regular or it's been years since your last visit, the warmth and authenticity here never change. Highly recommend for anyone craving a taste of Italy!"

Beautiful Italian cafe with tables and a patio with a fountain in the warmer weather months. Cappuccino served on glass.\n\nThe prices are good.\n\nThe owner was on site working with her employees and is very friendly to talk to.\n\nMy family used to live in the Corona neighborhood, and occasionally we commute to these stores From Astoria for nostalgia and the excellent Italian products."
