The pork shoulder was pretty gristly and not so flavorful.  But the place has a nice vibe and I will return to try other dishes.  It’s certainly great value for the money!  Whole meal with a drink was under $30.  Friendly staff."

Light on the salt which is an easy fix. But the meats we had were all bone dry and pretty tasteless. Frozen fries and unimaginative sides make  it even worse. But the service really tips the scale. Robotic, careless, rushed. On the verge of impolite. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to a friend."

            "text": "Pretty disappointed. I don’t eat Polish food often, but I remembered coming here years ago and thought I’d give it another try since I was in the neighborhood. It started off well—the tripe soup was actually really good.\n\nBut the Plate of Polish Specialties was a letdown. It came with three pierogis, two potato pancakes, kielbasa, hunter’s stew, and stuffed cabbage. Sounds great, right? But the cabbage was way too salty and not even hot in the middle. Honestly felt like it was leftover from the day before. The stew was even saltier—how do you mess up stew?\n\nThe kielbasa was tasty but such a tiny portion. The pierogis were fried and just okay. The one highlight? The potato pancakes. Crispy, hot, and really flavorful.\n\nAlso, they charged me $0.75 for extra sour cream. Come on. Between that and the salty food, I’m not coming back."

The sausages were super flavorful too. The location is super convenient, right by the train, and the cozy, rustic decor totally reminded me of a restaurant I visited in Prague years ago\n\nWe really loved the vibes, but the service left a lot to be desired. Maybe they’re going for that classic European service style but, this is NYC, and when the check comes with a suggested 20% tip, expectations are a little higher. We felt nervous to ask for water because our server seemed to have her bad day by our interaction, she never filled our glass didn’t check in at all after taking the order that she didn't realize we were missing one dish. The person who seemed to be busser helped pour us water and got our missing dish checked. Not ideal.\n\nThat said, the food and atmosphere were great, and we’d definitely consider coming back if we’re in the neighborhood."

He said we had to try Karczma in Greenpoint, as it’s his favorite Polish restaurant in the city.\n\nWe sat down in the rustic farmhouse interior while live Polish music played in the background. As I’ve gotten older, these are the nights that I’ve learned to appreciate more. A nice Friday night dinner with the homies, where the stressful work week feels like a distant memory. It’s a good antidote to the vicious cycles of self loathing or “what am I doing with my life” that can sometimes consume me.\n\nThe Polish homie ordered an authentic Polish dinner for us. Our feast for the 3 of us consisted of Hand made perogies, grilled plate for 3, Spicy beef Goulash, Traditional pork cutlet, herring in cream, potato pancakes, and roasted hocks in beer.\n\nI’m used to portion sizes at places in New York to be TINY, but these were enormous. We lowkey got mogged by all this food. The bang for your buck in here is INSANE. My favorites were the Mix grilled plate and the roasted hocks.\n\nThat mixed grilled plate for “3” is really for 5 GROWN men. So much meat. It was so damn good though, the bacon and chicken went crazy.\n\nThe roasted hocks is the shank portion of the pig's hind leg, and came with a big steak knife in it. It was rich and had a smoky flavor, and was so damn tender. Definitely get the roasted hocks if you come.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the herring in cream was just not for me. Was the fishiest fish I've ever tasted, but I'll try anything once.\n\n$60 each after tip was SO reasonable for this feast we had. I gotta start putting more respect on Polish food, that’s on me…\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov__"

            "text": "I went to this restaurant because of the great reviews and my love for pierogis, but I have to be honest—I wasn’t impressed. Quite the contrary.\n\nI ordered the Polish plate, and overall, everything lacked salt. The pierogis were very bland, and I couldn’t even tell what the fillings were. I believe there were three different kinds, but only the potato one was somewhat identifiable. The potato pancakes were completely tasteless—to the point where I honestly wondered if they had forgotten to buy salt!! The stuffed cabbage wasn’t any better. The only item with any flavor was the meat stew.\n\nI also sat at the counter, squeezed between the beer dispenser (literally in my face, see photo) and a very odd customer who started to make me uncomfortable. The bartender clearly noticed, but didn’t offer to move me even when other seats at the counter became available.\n\nOverall, the experience felt cold and unwelcoming. It was probably the first time I’ve ever dined somewhere without being asked how the food was or whether I needed anything else. No one even said goodbye when I got up to leave.\n\nFirst and last time!!\nGo to Pierozek! Much better."

The staff was friendly, attentive, witty and with a great sense of humor, which is, for me, a good first sign of a customer-oriented restaurant.\n\nThe variety of European beers was huge, mainly Polish beers, but I was ecstatic when I found Czech Pilsner on the menu! However the local delicacy is the hot cider with cinnamon and red mulled wine - typically served during winter months but here I was able to enjoy it in the middle of March!\n\nThe food was great, really well prepared and the way it is supposed to be (at least in Europe). It is truly original central European cuisine! The white borscht in bread was delicious despite the fact it was a rather small portion, but the Roasted Hocks in beer was huge! And super tasty, like I said, original to its core.\n\nI found the prices of meals and drinks very reasonable - main dishes were between $15 to $20. Toilets were clean and tidy despite the fact the restaurant was crowded.\n\nOverall if you want to try Polish food, come here, you wont regret it. I know I will come back! Paid by card.

I’ve practically sampled everything on the menu.\n\nThe white borsch served in a bread bowl is pure comfort—creamy, rich, and hearty. You can’t go wrong with the hunter’s bacon, a thick-cut, grilled delight paired with perfectly charred grilled onions—it’s a classic. The grilled asparagus wrapped in ham is another solid option. While I enjoy the salmon tartare, I’m not a fan of the oversized capers it’s served with, but you can easily pick them out.\n\nIf you’re new to Polish cuisine, start with the Plate of Specialties—it’s a great introduction. It includes pan-fried pierogies, crispy and flaky potato pancakes, grilled kielbasa, and stuffed cabbage filled with rice and meat, all smothered in tomato sauce (though that’s not my top pick here).\n\nFor a healthier option, the grilled salmon with dill sauce is fantastic and highly recommended. On the other hand, the roasted hocks in beer is a hefty portion but a bit too fatty for my taste."

Restauracja ta, znana z autentycznej polskiej kuchni, po raz kolejny udowodniła, że jest prawdziwym ambasadorem smaków naszej tradycji kulinarnej.\nNa początek zamówiłem Tatar wołowy – klasyczny, perfekcyjnie przygotowany. Mięso było najwyższej jakości, delikatne, a jednocześnie pełne smaku. Do tego doskonałe dodatki  min: kapary ,żółtko ,cebulka , które idealnie związało całość. Każdy kęs był niczym podróż do polskiego domu – prawdziwy majstersztyk.Następnie przyszła pora na Golonkę w piwie, która okazała się prawdziwą gwiazdą wieczoru. Mięso było tak miękkie, że niemal samo odchodziło od kości, a skórka – chrupiąca, idealnie wypieczona. Sos na bazie piwa miał głęboki, bogaty smak z lekką nutą karmelu, która pięknie podkreślała soczystość mięsa. Porcja była imponująca, a do tego podano tradycyjne dodatki – kapustę zasmażaną i ziemniaki, które dopełniły całe danie.Atmosfera w Karczmie była równie wyjątkowa – rustykalne wnętrze, przyjemna muzyka i serdeczna obsługa sprawiły, że czułem się jak w prawdziwej polskiej karczmie.\nPonadto w restauracji serwowane jest wyśmienite piwo z nalewaka jak: Żywiec Niemieckie HB oraz Czeski Pilsner.\nJeśli jesteś w Nowym Jorku i tęsknisz za polskimi smakami, Karczma na Greenpoincie to miejsce, które musisz odwiedzić. Golonka w piwie i tatar wołowy to pozycje obowiązkowe – polecam rownież Flaki. Gwarantuję, że nie pożałujesz!"

The flavors of the heavier meatier dishes are balanced perfectly with the carrot horseradish salad, Sauerkraut, beet salad, etc. Welcoming service. Large booths. Great bear on draft. Full bar. Perfect for a hearty, comfort food meal."

It is also not the cheapest, but I recommend it to anyone who likes it or Such places and Polish cuisine. Although for Polish cuisine I recommend flying to Poland xD or visiting Polish friends who can cook their traditional dishes, not burnt pork chops"

I grew up on many of these dishes and it is always worth the trip to Greenpoint. The staff was also friendly and attentive. Especially the male server with the blonde coloured hair whose name I believe starts with a g. Sorry, I forget names often but not faces. Will definitely go back when he is there.\n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone who enjoys good food."

Great lunch offer (soup and main dish for around $15), great pierogies, white borscht in bread. Stuffed cabbage wasn’t my favorite, maybe I was comparing it to my moms food too much 😂\nBut basically when I miss home, I’m just going there."

Just stepping in here is like traveling to Poland, between the homey decor and all the staff speaking Polish to one another. All the food is excellent - covering all the traditional Polish menu items one would expect. It’s also a great value and very very filling. I guarantee you’ll not leave this place hungry!"

I also ordered the polish specialties.  That was great too. They had a performance,  two guys singing and playing a woodwind instrument.  I would definitely come back. Everything was awesome.  Nice decor. We got our food quickly.  Lots of tables. Service was excellent."

If there is a wait, start your meal by the bar; they will be happy to move you to a table later.\n\nThe cocktail list was very interesting - while they were tasty, they all tend to be on the sweeter side (Karczma's Apple Pie, Nutcracker, Greenpoint).\n\nThe two of us shared the following: White Borscht, Plate of Polish Specialties, Grilled Blood Sausage, and Cucumber Salad. The portions were very generous, so start small to not over overstuff yourself. Everything was delicious, and we were so glad to find a well made blood sausage dish in NYC."

I ordered potato pancakes for my daughter, and they were absolutely disgusting—dry and full of grease. I spoke with the administrator, who promised to refund my money, but that never happened. I do not recommend."
