Their cucumber water and mango mint tea were very refreshing and had no added sugar so they tasted the way the drink is mean to taste. I had the pickles in a jar (home made), dumpling stir fry and tres leches cake. All were delicious and very well made. I wpuld highly recommend it. The staff was very friendly, patient and amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for some good food."

Me and my absolutely blazing hot companion of the fairer formature took a chance on one of the most bopping eateries in Bay Ridge. And well, well, well. Where. To. Start. I showed my lady to her seat, body? 10. Face? 10. Personality? 10. Eitherwho, upon relieving my legs, a.k.a. sitting, I was pleased to see two glasses of water for me and my lady. I was even more pleased that upon the drinkalage of this beverage I realized it had been infused with cucumber. I was immediately refreshed, energized, eagerly in wait for what I could feel was something bedazzling. Coffee? 10. Entrees? 10. Perfectly seasoned. Perfectly portioned. Yes indeed. Yes indeed. But what I could not have expected was that upon the simmering señorita’s request for a baked specialty, it was brought to us almost immediately after we finished our entrees, of course. I was already satisfied, but be trusting, the most cunning and cletaverous cadaver could not say no to a face like that. Anywho, dessert. Yes. Life altering. Incredible. Furthest thing from inedible. I would like to thank the Common for an absolute bedazzler of a breakfast outing. Go here folks, don’t let these inferior restaurants act as your shepherd. No. No. No. Go to the Common. Yes… yes… yes…"

We each started with the homemade mango iced tea, and pickle cup...\n\nThen I had the homemade poached egg skillet that tasted and very similar to shashuka with perfectly poached eggs and fresh mozzarella and side of pita. And my girlfriend had the avocado naan with eggs, side of breakfast sausage that was similar to a kielbasa flavor profile wise. We like it so much we might go back tomorrow for a second time in 3 days.\n\nBut highly recommend anyone in the area looking for somewhere to eat breakfast or lunch. Was a pleasant surprise."

For starters, there's nothing common about the menu. It's sorta gourmet without the fuss, hip without the funk, eclectic without the confusion of fusion.  I took pictures of the menu to post because it will speak for itself, if you'll take it from me that it delivers on its promise. Service is casual, but attentive.  Ambience is a cross between rustic and industrial.  It's coolness is muted, so comfortable.  Maybe almost too muted--you might walk right past it at the corner of third avenue and 94th Street, down from the Walgreens.  Don't do that. Go in. But it's been discovered, so count on a wait.\nBut worth the wait."

So we got dressed and took a walk to the restaurant and low and behold, the restaurant was open!\n\nStuffed with people, The Common was moving and jiving as always. Luckily, they had a small table in the back, so we took a seat, and peered over the menus. We decided what we wanted, just at the same time someone swooped over to deliver our water, our starter drinks, take our orders and get everything in the works.\n\nNo more than 10 minutes later...\n\nPicturesque plates of scrumptious food were delivered to our table, with customizations on-point; Everything perfect.  The Fresh Toast Sammich - My Man consumed that faster than a shredder machine gets through a tax return.  Seriously.  It was perfect.   My Ratatouille was drop-your-fork-roll-your-head-back-in-amazement divine.   It was so good, I was shocked that ratatouille could BE that good.  I personally make ratatouille, and mine is delicious but it isn't THAT amazing.\n\nWe finished as much as we could, because portions were hefty, took the leftovers (because leaving that would have been stupidity) and paid our bill.  Very affordable - two people for under $40.  Left a large tip, because they certainly deserve it, picked up our bag of yummies, and headed home.\n\nWe visit The Common consistently; Usually once a week.  It's a staple business in our community, and it's an incredible gem for those who are visiting from outside of Bay Ridge or for the locals who haven't been before."

I emptied the entire plate and drink my wide mug of cappuccino. I was in food heaven. My wife got her Eggs Benedict and i tried each bite of her plate and that was also fantastic. The potatoes were well seasoned and had a nice bite to it. Honestly you cannot go wrong here.

We started off with chips and dip appetizer and mango mint iced tea. Loved the take on the chips and dip. The dip was fabulous with smoked salmon and cream fraiche. The tea was okay very watery and unsweetened. We had to ask for sugar. We then got eggs Benedict with fried chicken and skillet number 2. Loved both the dishes. The skillet had a sour and tangy soupy broth with potatoes and poached eggs served with pita. The egg Benedict was delicious as well. However the fried chicken lacked seasoning. Would have loved if it had a little more flavor to it. It came with a side of fried potatoes and arugula. The portion sizes were good and the food was very filling.

We ordered the chicken and waffles (interesting flavor with cheddar but chicken was overcooked and it was just a thigh cutlet so won't order again); Latin Breakfast and California Omelet (other dishes were enjoyed). The worse part of our experience was when I asked for water and then my friend did the same, the server took my glass and placed it in between her arm pit and breast. I would not eat here again."

I even tried a avocado smoothie, which was so yummy!!!\n\nWe had the\nThe smoked salmon avocado toast (I got a side of pesto - which helped a lot!)\nThe Skillet Pancake\nThe Cheesy Grits and\nSausage.\n\nService was a bit delayed, but they were doing several things at once.\n\nIt feels like a homey place that you could go to with friends, def not fancy which is nice for brunch sometimes"

I was happily surprised by how much I liked their breakfast sandwich.  It’s petite for light appetites.  All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.  I would skip the mint tea, tastes like cinnamon."

They definitely know what a customer service is. Food on time, coffee on time, need to share a plate - that’s noted too without you asking of it. Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast"
