The two Chinese restaurants across the street are just disgusting when you walk in and their fried chicken is kinda dirty. Not surprising since their fry oil have seen more use than this place.\nService is good. But you don’t interact much.\nThe atmosphere is nice. There’s WiFi so you can hang out here with a laptop. If they have coffee that would be nice. Just need something cheap and not franchise."

One of my gripes with this place is that there isn’t a consistency with the recipes. The first time I went there there was one employee working and the sweetness of the tea was perfect. But then the second time it was significantly sweeter and we ordered the same thing.\n\nAlso a lot of these reviews seem fake and unauthentic, sure the accounts are real but it seems like they’re asking ppl they know to leave reviews. At the moment for this I’ll need to knock off one more star."
