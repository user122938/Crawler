I’ve tried something new off the menu each time I’ve gone and it’s all been a hit especially their infamous biryani! Love the drink selections as well, I personally go for either the piña colada or mango lassi which pair perfectly with all their dishes. The staff here is so attentive and kind. Any concerns will be met with full attention and is resolved swiftly. Overall a lovely place and plan to continuously visit."

The angara kabab was just spice forward and did not really have a unique taste to it, but the chicken was well cooked.\n\nService was relatively quick and food arrived within 25 mins of placing the order. Overall, a very pleasant experience and a great option in the neighborhood!"

I ultimately decided on the gobi Manchurian, samosa chaat, pav bhaji, malai kofta, and garlic naan. All of the food was delicious and brought in a timely manner. The wait staff were nice and attentive. I never had to ask them to refill my water, nor did I have to wait too long for them to come to my table to write my order. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, perfect for date night or for lunch/dinner with family or friends. It is slightly on the pricy side, but I think it’s worth it.

While the restaurant itself is very clean, quiet, and has a lovely ambiance, the food didn’t quite meet our expectations. The taste was average – we’d rate it around 5 out of 10 – and the portion sizes were surprisingly small considering how expensive the menu was. Unfortunately, the pricing doesn’t match the quality or quantity of the food. It’s a beautiful place to sit and enjoy a peaceful meal, but we were hoping for better value and taste overall."

The service was excellent, with our waiter going above and beyond to ensure we were happy. He was attentive, checked in regularly, and even encouraged us to share honest feedback about the food, which we really appreciated.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the samosa chaat and gobi Manchurian. My family loved the samosa chaat, though I personally found it a tad too sweet for my taste. However, the gobi Manchurian was a standout—it was so delicious! As someone who’s usually a picky eater and not a big fan of vegetables, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered naan and butter chicken, which was good but leaned a bit on the sweeter side; the chicken parda biryani, which was flavorful and tasty; and the chicken malai kebab, which was tender and cooked well.\n\nThe drinks, though, stole the show for us. The mojitos were fantastic—our favorites were the strawberry mojito and especially the guava mojito, which was so refreshing and light.\n\nOverall, Red Chilli was a great dining experience. While the food could use a little fine-tuning to balance some flavors, the amazing service, stunning ambiance, and delicious drinks made it worth the visit. We’ll definitely be back for those mojitos and to try more of their menu!"

The menu said it comes with hot sauce but we weren’t paying for a bunch of dry chicken pieces and a Chinese sauce!\n\nI live in Manhattan and was told food in Queens is great.

As you step past the red roses and into the restaurant, you’re welcomed into a trendy, clean, and bright space — and greeted warmly by the friendly staff.

For appetizers, don’t miss the Dahi Puri — little crunchy clouds filled with yogurt, sauces, lentils, and topped with pomegranate seeds. Be sure to eat them quickly before they get soggy! The steamed chicken dumplings are another excellent choice.\n\nFor entrees, you can’t go wrong with the Lamb Parda Biryani — beautifully presented in a pot, baked under a layer of dough, and dramatically opened tableside by your server. Other must-tries include the goat curry (on the bone) 🌶️, the lamb shank in a rich, flavorful sauce, and the red chilli special Chicken Angara Kabab.\n\nHighly recommended for a delicious dinner!"

Inside the restaurant is beautiful, appropriately lit, and elegant. We enjoyed the decor and ambiance before we even decided what to order. For drinks, we got the blue lagoon and the lime refresher. Both were great. My husband ended up getting the chicken kali mirch, while I chose the lobster dish (I forgot the name, but it came in a gravy that contained white wine, which I asked our server AJ if it could be made without it and he confirmed it could). We also ordered a butter chicken to share and the chili garlic naan. I really appreciated that you can customize the spice to your preference, as a lot of Indian places cater to  the “western” palate of more mild seasonings. I really enjoyed the lobster dish; it was flavored and spiced perfectly. It came with mushrooms, and although seemed out of place for this dish, it actually was a great side; seasoned nicely and had great texture. My husband loved the chicken kali mirch; we ended up taking the remaining gravy home so he could eat it with the leftover naan/rice. The butter chicken (not pictured) was the only thing that fell short of my expectations. It had an unpleasant sweetness to it and the gravy was not velvety or creamy. It was the only thing that was a disappointment, especially since it’s such a mainstream and popular dish. Service was perfect; our server was knowledgeable on the menu items, very polite and amicable, and you can tell he truly cares about providing his guests with an outstanding experience. We would definitely return to try the other items next time!"

Ambience is great for families but also for couples. Food was fantastic and portion size was great. They also ask for some of the dishes what spice level we would like and nailed it. Drinks were delicious though I do wish you got a larger portion."

We loved the spicy frozen guava mocktail and Rupee beer with the flavorful food. The gobi manchurian was crispy, and the mango walnut salad was fresh. The butter chicken masala, lamb chops, and dum goat biryani were all full of rich, bold flavors. The tandoori platter had a great mix of kebabs and shrimp. We finished with dal halwa and rose falooda kulfi—both were delicious. Highly recommend this spot!"

The ambiance added to the delicious food and the service from Kumar and the rest of the staff was stellar. I don’t think I’ve been to a restaurant where everyone was helpful. There were times I’d need something and any of them were willing to assist."

We ordered the butter chicken and tikka masala chicken because last time we got the butter chicken and it was really good and this time we couldn't choose one over the either, but both of them came out as a banger but this time I personally liked the tikka masala chicken a bit more or maybe it was just like the color it was so rich and the chicken was a bit more tender and the chili chicken was spot on. It was absolutely delicious. However, the nan had a kind of weird but not bad aftertaste but I still really enjoyed it. I love this place and I can't wait to come back for the chili chicken and tikka masala."

The biriyani with the naan on top was pretty cool to try and the butter chicken was good too. Portions are good as well. Drinks pictured are blue lagoon and mango lassi. They're both refreshing, but I'd definitely recommend the mango lassi more with the Indian dishes."

I love how the restaurant is articulated as it does cater to what many people look for when it comes to fine dining while enjoying cultural food; however, the best part is the food’s delicious. This is such a gem of a find, the ambience is great for birthday’s, anniversary, or no occasion at all with loved ones or alone. I have tried way too many of the items from the menu to list them all. My top favorites are the steamed chicken dumplings, their butter chicken which I usually ask to be made spicy and they deliver. I pair that with the blue lagoon drink. The afghani kabab is so succulent and always cooked perfectly. Lamb shank soft and seasoned well. Staff are a 10/10 each time have been AMAZING! I really hope they keep with the high expectations they set to their customers."
