            "text": "I recently visited Boardwalk Beer Garden and had an overall enjoyable experience, though there’s definitely room for improvement. The food is decent—nothing particularly memorable, but it gets the job done if you’re looking for something casual to go with your drink. The real highlight here is the beer selection: with about ten different options on tap, there’s enough variety to keep most beer lovers satisfied. Whether you’re into lagers, IPAs, or something more adventurous, you’ll likely find something to enjoy.\n\nThe staff is friendly, upbeat, and welcoming, which really helps set a laid-back tone. However, things could be a bit more organized—orders can take a while, and there’s some confusion during busy hours. To be fair, they’re working under tough conditions with lots of loud, sometimes unruly customers, which can’t be easy.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, making it a solid spot to hang out with friends or unwind after a long day, especially if you’re into a boardwalk vibe. It’s not a must-visit destination, but it’s a good, casual stop if you’re in the area and want a beer and a bite. I’d give it 4 stars mostly for the vibes and drink selection."

The venue, chefs and staff rallied magnificently, put on the Islanders game and we had a good time!\n\nI would love a bit more beer variety, especially add a couple of sour ales and a cider or two, but the food was above all reproach (proper crispy wings!!)"

Omg Brighton Beach thanks you! They stay open until 1a every night. Beer is amazzzing all my favorites including Paulaner and Krusovice on tap!\n\n*They have Thursday night and Monday night NFL here as well as all NHL and UFC contests....\n\n** I had the amazing ribeye steak tonight.

It’s clear the owner invested a lot of money into the design and details. Very chill and comfortable environment. Plenty of TVs all around for all sports and current events.\n\nAs for the staff, I don’t think I’ve experienced better service in Brooklyn. Extremely attentive, they clean the empty places and rubbish every couple minutes from the tables, and are actually looking to do and offer anything they can to better your meal (sauces, sides, etc) . It’s the little things that staff pay attention to that makes the staff here stand out. The bartender is very much a people person, smiling and adding the necessary attention and detail to each drink.\n\nThe food is out of this world. Even the simple foods seem to taste better here again because of the little details added to the plate. The most important thing is the food is consistent. It’s not the first time we’ve come but because of our experiences we know that no matter when we come the food will be consistent and we will have a good time.\n\nThe place does also have security so safety is no concern.\n\nHighly highly recommend this place whether you’re local or just visiting Brighton Beach. This owner really cares to give you the best experience.  5 stars all around."
