The place had a nice energy with a modern look and a comfortable crowd.\n\nThe kitchen was fast and the food was excellent. The ghorme sabzi had deep flavor and tender meat. The tahdig was golden and crisp, and the kabob was juicy and well seasoned with saffron rice and grilled tomatoes.\n\nThe servers, however, weren’t very attentive. Drinks sat empty for a while, and it took some effort to get their attention. For two people, the total was about $120, which felt fair for the quality.\n\nOverall, Eyval delivers top Persian food and a great vibe, but the service could be more engaged to match the kitchen’s pace."

Not only was Service very slow in our server only managed to check in on us once throughout the whole meal, After we had finished everything we ordered, we decided we needed one more entrée to feel fully satiated as the portions were a lot smaller than we expected. At that time, our server informed us that we were out of dining time and could only pick from three very appetizer dip like options. We had 15 minutes left on our reservation and had to leave. It’s one thing to try to remove a table that is not eating and drinking. It’s another thing to literally cut someone’s meal short and all the tables around us were still eating and drinking. There should’ve been no issue with us ordering another $50 entrée.\n\nCustomer service matters."

I did not get treated very well and they continually kicked my chair walking by the whole time and made me feel unwelcome. This was the end of the night so it wasn’t even busy that these type of actions could be understood.

The food is unique—not typical Iranian cuisine, but an interesting fusion. The atmosphere, however, is often cold and a bit loud. Most of the clientele seems younger and largely unfamiliar with Iranian food.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was my recent experience. I had made a reservation for six people a month in advance. The day before, I had an out-of-town guest join and asked to add one more seat. I emailed twice, but only on the day of the reservation did I receive a response saying they could not accommodate an additional person. This forced us to change all our plans. I find it very poor service to turn away a repeat customer over one extra seat—something that could reasonably fit at any table.\n\nI am leaving this review because I believe customer service should still matter. Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend this restaurant to friends or family. New York City has many excellent and welcoming dining options, and I would suggest exploring those instead of a place unwilling to show even minimal flexibility for loyal customers."

Chenjeh was also fantastic. For both dishes, I would happily give them more than five stars if I could. Koobideh was good, on the upper side of good, I would rate it 4.5 stars. Ghormeh sabzi and tahdig were both below my expectations, I gave them 4 stars.\n\nOverall, the restaurant experience was more of a 4.5 to 4, but I had to choose between 4 and 5 stars, it would definitely be 4. I will definitely return if it’s only for the lamb ribs!"

You have to absolutely try their Ghalieh Mahi."

Last minute, a small child came with us. With no expectations, we were told she couldn’t be accommodate and can go on my lap. No problem. Coincidentally, at the “communal” table- a nice couple let us use a spare chair they weren’t. I then seated the child. Immediately, the hostess (?) came storming over to prevent the child from sitting there.. a chair that wasn’t even being used, and wouldn’t be used as this couple was the last party of the evening to be seated there.. ROFL!! What a turn off and joke. I insisted I am not moving the kid and this is reaching and she pissed off thank god. We spent hundreds of dollars and tipped well, that was so extra and could’ve resulted in loss of customers! She was short, heavy, and had yellow/orange toned hair. Not sure her name but would really train her better because that was SO unsettling."

I would highly recommending trying the scallops, lamb ribs, date salad, whipped  feta with bread, eggplant and koobideh. We tried the main chicken entree too, but found the rice with raisins and cranberries a little too sweet for our liking but the chicken was cooked perfectly. The saffron dessert was also a fave!

            "text": "Eyval was nothing short of fantastic! This was my first time trying Persian food and I was truly amazed by every dish we tried. The flavor combinations were unique and delicious, with the perfect mix of sweet and savory. We tried both the komaj bread and barbari bread, which had perfect textures of soft and fluffy. The citrus date salad was super refreshing and light with deep flavors from the dressing and dates, which was the perfect appetizer. We decided to try the lamb ribs, octopus kabob, and kabob koobideh as our entrees. The meat for all dishes were amazingly tender and flavorful, with the ribs falling right off the bone and the octopus perfectly chewy. The star of the shows in these dishes however, was the tomato butter that was served on top of the basmati rice in the kabob koobideh! It was so savory without being salty and wish there was more on the plate. I recommend all of these to share!\n\nThe interior was simple but beautifully designed, creating a nice ambiance that takes you out of New York City.  As you walk further in, you’re able to view the kitchen where chefs are carefully crafting each dish.\n\nThe service was exceptional also! Our server was very attentive to our table, making sure dishes were cleared and plates were swapped out for an easy dining experience. I also mentioned it was my birthday and they served my dessert with candle, which was a very thoughtful gesture.\n\nOverall, this place was the perfect birthday dinner and glad I ventured out to try new food here! We are already thinking about our next visit to try more of their menu as I’m sure every dish will not disappoint."

Kinda tastes like Mediterranean but a bit more spiced?\n\nThe mast o musir is a thick yogurt dip that tastes garlicky & sweet. Rly good with the barbari bread. Komaj is a bit softer kinda like dinner roll, would get more of the babari. LOVED the squash 😋 Perfectly roasted to bring out the sweetness!! Pumpkin seeds, pomegranate, and feta all complement each other very well. Lamb was a bit tough so skip that and get the super tender wagyu kabob.\n\n💕 Barbari Bread $6\n💕 Mast o Musir $9*\n💕 Komaj Bread $5\n💕 Butternut Squash & Feta $18*\n💕 Lamb Ribs $22\n💕 Kabob Chenjeh $28*\n💕 Almond and Pistachio Cake $14\n\n요즘 계속 페르시안 요리가 피드에 뜨길래 나도 먹으러 와봄. 위치가 부쉬위크라서 밥만 먹기엔 멀다고 느껴진다. 좀더 가까운 sofreh로 도전하기. 맛은 지중해식이랑 비슷한데 요게 좀더 향신료가 쎈 느낌…? 두가지 빵 중엔 barbari가 더 쫀쫀해서 좋구  양갈비는 질기니까 패스. 와규 케밥은 굳!!"

So the food is really really good. I think that the kabob wasn’t as tender and hot as I expected, maybe it was busy so the plate sat for a bit, I understand. However at these price points I expect it to be close to perfect, especially in this area.\n\nThe yogurt + bread combo was out of this world.

            "text": "I was wowed by my experience at Ey-vál. This has been one of the best Persian food I have had, they certainly ey-vál which is a Farsi(Persian) word that adds positive emphasis to an idea. I’m surprised they are not in the Michelin guide but I’m sure they will make it sooner than later.\n\nThe service was top notch. Super friendly and professional, fairly fast, knowledgeable about the menu and attentive.\n\nAmbiance was dark, enigmatic, hip, I liked it a lot.\n\nThe food, what we came for, was beyond delicious. We started with the Mast o Musir and I gotta admit I have had great ones before and thought it would be hard to beat, but this one goes to the top of the list now. So so creamy, with shallots cut at the perfect size and acidity balanced out.\n\nI continued with a salad( can’t remember its name) and while this was not a truly Persian dish, I loved the modern approach and all the flavors they accomplished on this dish. It was my second favorite dish after the mast o musir.\n\nThe lamb ribs were a solid dish. The sauce had the perfect sweetness/acidity as well as spiciness and the barberry on top complemented so sell.\n\nThe two kabobs were nicely done but my favorite was the koobideh. This is a personal preference as I’m more into koodideh than steak kabob. I understand the chenjeh is more premium, but it is just my preference. All in all, the 2 kabobs were 5 out 5 stars.\n\nTahdig which is one of my favorite Persian dishes and a really simple dish, was perfection in a single bite. That sauce they had the rice on, it was spot on. They made it also so good looking. I loved it.\n\nYou can’t leave a Persian restaurant without having Persian ice cream. However, to be honest it didn’t do it for me. There were a few flaws : typical Persian ice cream sandwich is with crispy and thin waffles, this one was with a soggy bread, also the ice cream was not as creamy as it should be. The ice cream sandwich was subpar compared to the high quality of the food I had.\n\nAll in all, looking forward to my next time at Ey-vál. Please open a location in Miami :)"

The staff is joyful, present, and real, their genuine smiles and eager assistance in seeing you enjoy your meal a rarity.\n\nI started with the komaj bread, soft and fragrant with cumin and turmeric. Perfect on its own or even better when paired with the mast o musir. This strained yogurt laced with pickled shallots and turmeric oil is tangy, silky, sharp. It became my go-to dip for almost everything. The citrus date & cabbage salad arrived with color and crunch. Dates brought chew and oranges brought light. A bit overdressed, yes, but forgivable. The idea was right. Then came the lamb ribs. These were spectacular, fall-off-the-bone tender and rich with a tamarind-date sauce, layered with walnut crunch and bursts of barberry tang. A five-star meat moment. This was, without a doubt, the dish of the night. The tahdig, golden, crispy rice studded with almonds, pistachios, barberries, and candied orange offered a perfect foil for the richer mains. The hashoo mahi, a recommendation from the waiter, showcased well seared, high-quality fish, elevated by a fragrant saffron butter and a sweet pomegranate tamarind glaze. Eyval serves persian food, yes, but it celebrates it as well. Return visits is not a question, but more an inevitability."

Very conversation friendly.\nEverything we tried was good, but the lamb ribs were my favorite, very flavorful and tender.\nThe ice cream sandwich was good but the rose water flavor was a bit too strong for my taste.\nI tried the Sekanjabin cocktail, it was refreshing but lacked a distinct flavor.\nI preferred the Havig cocktail, which had a more unique taste.\nAlso loved the calligraphy on their menu, and the writings on the placements.\nI will go back to try other items on the menu as well."

We shared a bunch of dishes, and honestly, everything that hit the table was a win. The kebabs were juicy and the small plates had so much flavor packed into them.\n\nThe vibe was really cool too—lively without being too loud, stylish but not overdone. It felt like a great mix of traditional and modern. Definitely a spot I’ll be coming back to, and if you’ve got Persian friends who are picky about food (like mine), this is the place to take them."

On top of that, it’s super reasonably priced— for a group of 4, we shared several main dishes, had 3 rounds of bread, 2 different dips, dessert and a drink each… came out to $70/pp. Hard to find this kind of excellence in NYC dining these days tbh but Eyval has it on lock 💯💯"

He was very knowledgeable, attentive, professional, and positive. I enjoyed the barbari bread dipped with the star of feta spread in a fig jam with basil oil. I loved the kabob Chenjeg, waygu beef- medium. It was perfect. The kabob koobideh with waygu beef and lamb brisket was also very delicious. The rice was light and perfect. The ambiance was excellent, and I love the paper place mats with beautiful quotes."

The highlight of our meal was the tender lamb ribs, cooked to perfection with a subtle blend of spices that made each bite melt in your mouth. The freshness of the ingredients was evident in every dish. Husband’s favorite dish was the sea bass over crab rice.\n\nThe service was exceptional—attentive without being overbearing. The overall experience was a wonderful introduction to Persian cuisine for the family. Our teen kids also loved it!"

Lamb ribs were really a highlight, they are quite heavy but the portion isn't gigantic. Also would recommend the cabbage and date salad and the half chicken (which doesn't actually seem to be half a chicken in the way you are probably thinking...It seemed to all be breast meat...but it still enough as a main course for two people if you got smaller plates too).\nThe drinks were a highlight too, they're Sharbats are really interesting non-alcoholic options. Their cocktail menu had some good house variations on classic drinks, and the Persian tea old fashioned was a really great sipper."

The bread is super soft and chewy with the taste of garlicky creamy yogurt dip 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼 got the lamb ribs and octopus kebob as the main dishes. Incredible flavor. For the dessert, I had the saffron ice cream sandwich, super refreshing, it’s like having a cup of rose tea pairing pistachio, but in an ice cream version during hot summer. Forgot to mention, the pomegranate whiskey sour cocktail was also amazing. 🤩 for sure coming back to tryout other dishes 🙌🏼"
