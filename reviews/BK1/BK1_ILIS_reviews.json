            "text": "Omg, so, bad..\n\nI visited once about 1.5 years ago, loved it, visit back, man, somebody tell me what happened during the past 1.5 years:\n\nService was pretty good overall, they had this Halloween theme going on, passionate about the dishes and all that,\n\nexcept several times they forgot their lines (could be too much party the previous night, understandable.) also no one greeted us when we leave, very strange, we just walked out of the place like that.\n\nLet me start with the beverage pairing, it was a disaster. We got served with a cheap Japanese whisky, oaky and a bit smokey during seafood course, and there was no white wine across the whole menu.. first drink was a full glass of dry martini.. second drink natural wine was so natural it tasted like what wine makers use in biodynamic methods (ifkyk).\n\nNot a big fan of the seasonal menu this time, but this is depending on your taste. they served tuna bone twice once sashimi once cooked. They served sesame course twice, one was with caviar. Problem is the sesame wasn’t very fresh so the smell covers the whole dish you couldn’t taste others. There was a dish where you grind veggies together to make a paste, then spread over sour dough, creative. Our server did it right by grinding it over his palm, I did see other servers grind it on customer’s table and making big noise, common sense.\n\nAmbient was amazing which I like. Total 1k + for 2 pax without tips."

            "text": "I’ve been wanting to try Ilis for a long time. I live across the street and walk by it every day, always admiring its interior—without question one of the most beautiful restaurant spaces I’ve ever seen. The lighting, materials, and atmosphere are stunning. Unfortunately, the experience didn’t live up to the setting.\n\nI went with a couple of friends just planning to have a cocktail, but we ended up ordering a few small plates to share. I explained clearly to the bartender that I prefer dry, non-sweet drinks and gave specific examples, yet the cocktail I was recommended—though decent—was far too sweet and completely missed the mark. When I mentioned this, the bartender’s reaction was dismissive and slightly aggressive, which made the interaction uncomfortable and took away from the experience.\n\nWe ordered the sourdough with butter and nightshades, which looked promising. The nightshades were flavorful, but the butter had a slightly rancid, sour taste that lingered unpleasantly. The bread itself was fine but plain, and the portioning was frustrating—only one slice cut in half, which wasn’t nearly enough to pair with the generous amount of butter and toppings. Even after asking for more bread, it still felt unbalanced.\n\nThe whelk dish was by far the most disappointing. I’ve had whelk before and enjoyed it elsewhere, but here it was overwhelmingly strong and left a harsh, savory taste that lingered long after eating. It completely overpowered everything else, including my drink, and it didn’t sit well with me physically—I ended up with an upset stomach and felt slightly sick afterward.\n\nI wanted to love Ilis. The space is beautiful, the concept ambitious, and it clearly has a following. But between the overly sweet cocktail, unbalanced small plates, and the unpleasant whelk, the experience fell short. Ilis has all the potential to be extraordinary, but my visit left me disappointed and in no rush to return."

If you come here please try the meringue angel foodcake, trout and cotton candy drink. FYI: THE WHOLE COURSE TAKES 2 TO 3 HOURS SO BE READY TO WAIT. In general though this restaurant is amazing! 🔥👌🔥"

            "text": "Finally satisfied a longing I’ve had to visit and dine with Ilis. Each day time someone dines with a restaurant is an opportunity to make their day. I’d say Ilis has done so for my entire gastronomical fall season\n\nTo quote the Michelin guide: The brainchild of Noma-alum (and co-founder) Mads Refslund and his business partner Will Douillet, Ilis seeks to elevate the dining experience through every touchpoint.\n\nIt has succeeded. In fact, I’d say beyond elevation and has shot for and reached the moon.\n\nI’ve dreamed of visiting Noma, and so upon reading about Ilis’ opening, my curiosity was piqued. The experience is both dazzling and comforting. At times one can feel, as someone once put, little when experiencing fine dining. I brought my niece for late  birthday celebrations, and I noted her wonder, surprise, but also ease in being there.\n\nThe dining experience was a like a symphony with rich segments, harmonies, and crescendos. When is the last time you found yourself unable to describe flavors of a dish? Or so compelled to simply sit in silence allowing all presence to go towards your taste buds. These are desperate attempts to put in words an indescribable feeling, brought to you by Ilis 🤍\n\nThank you to Breanna (forgive a potential misspelling), our gracious server; Ian, the exquisite sommelier with whom I shared a delicately profound reflection over a glass of cabernet franc; and of course Mads for the wonderful surprising creations🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾"

            "text": "Still sitting at the restaurant while writing this out of boredom. We sat down at 5:30 and now it is almost 9, we still have 1/3 of the dish not served yet.\n\nFood is not good tasting. I feel like they just don’t know how to cook food to make them delicious, more like experimenting new ways to cook just for the sake of it. It is either too sour, or too raw, or too plain.\n\nServing speed is really slow. Prepare for a night of sitting around and waiting - they have severs and cooks rotate and serve so everybody is doing something they are not good at at some points of the night. Maybe that’s why.\n\nVery expensive, too. We had the filed guide, pretty steep price even for find dining. But the worst taste and one of the worse services I have had. And I am usually accompanying my wife at these fine dining places so I had very little complains usually. But I felt strongly to write this (also bored just waiting). My wife passed on more than half of the dishes because she just couldn’t justify eating them after having a taste. And she is more than happy to eat the food I cook at home, and I am just a freaking regular guy.\n\nVery not recommended. Save yourself the time and money and don’t bother coming.\n\nOh just before I am going to submit this review, they actually brought our bill- and we still have 3 dishes left!!!! What a joke"

In fact, I often find myself telling others that it was one of my most disappointing tasting menu experiences. I was expecting great things given the restaurants legacy, and from the many positive reviews from NYT to The Infatuation. BLUF - when your atmosphere, fine dining service take the focus away from or are at the expense of the taste of the dishes, you’ve gone astray. Great service, great atmosphere, but truly a 2/5 on taste."

The flow of service felt so natural and everything was timed perfect. This definitely added a lot to the experience!\n\nAnd omg the food and drinks? It was not your average menu. They've got some really creative and original dishes and cocktails that were unique but also nostalgic. Every dish and cocktail were so well thought out. We were truly blown away.\n\nOverall, ILIS was a really enjoyable experience. It's a bit different from your typical restaurant, in the best way possible. If you're looking for a place in Greenpoint with a unique atmosphere, great service, and food/drinks, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. I'm already thinking about going back!"

Cocktails were nice and the server was friendly and helped choose nice wine pairings for dinner. We were very excited for the food but each of the 14 courses were just one let down after another. The scallop was the highlight and maybe the potato but it wasn’t enough to make me want to ever come back. I was really looking forward to having some nice tuna but they served us the carcass of the tuna as a ceviche type course bit there was barely any tuna on it. They then took the carcass after we finished flipped it over and served it to us again with new seasoning? Not good enough. There wasn’t enough fish to even appreciate what they were trying to do. At this price point there are so many better options in the area. Maybe we just came on a bad night?"

ILIS was such a disappointment.\nReservations may seem like they are booked out however it is just a marketing stunt to make it seem like they are busy but they really aren’t. Online they only showed availability for 6:45-7pm but when we were there, there was only one other table.\nTheir field guid option where the chef supposedly chooses your dishes “signature dishes” for you was such a let down a 3hr meal and everything was raw, except the duck which was also under cooked. I thought they had to be cooking something amazing if the food was taking this long.\nOne would think letting the chef choose for you “field guide” the chefs would bring out the best or come up with a tasting menu that’s more than over salted/seasoned raw food. Sad to say I couldn’t get out of there fast enough and go down to the corner to get a couple slices of pizza"

Beautiful restaurant, makes it feel special the moment you walk in. And very chill service, which I appreciate at a fancy restaurant. Worth going for a celebratory dinner. I see some comments here complaining about the the price, but they seem very fair. This is the price for such a high end experience in NYC. So save up and enjoy! P.S. Mads wearing the turtle neck under the apron is a great look. Makes him look like the Pep Guardiola of chefs."

            "text": "What a disappointment. They served a raw pork chop around the bone without a warning. When we asked our lovely server/bartender if that was how they cook pork, she went “back” and asked the “chef.” Our bartender then informed us that that’s how they cook the pork. Now, a little pink is okay, but this was entirely raw around the bone. That also would have been fine if we had been told how they source the meat and given a heads-up that this is how they prepare the dish. We probably would have ordered raw pork anyway if it had been clearly marked on the menu. Can you imagine going to a German restaurant and mett isn’t marked as raw? Probably not.\n\nOur bartender asked if there was anything they could do, and we said not really, since we had already eaten the food. After that, nobody checked on us, mentioned any desserts, or asked if we wanted anything else. Mind you, we were there to watch the Super Bowl, and they had advertised that there would be draft beers (there was one) and pork sammies (none). Towards the end of halftime, we asked for the check and were rather surprised to see that we weren’t even comped for a drink.\n\nWhen we mentioned our surprise to our bartender, she called the “manager,” and oh boy—I’ve had better interactions with drunk college students in dive bars. First of all, I was there with my husband, and the dish was for two, but the manager chose to talk directly and only to me. Because I was sitting on a bar chair, his face was in my face the entire time. I was aggressively questioned about why we even ate the pork if it was raw—um, because it was served under dim bar lighting—and he was just confrontational for absolutely no reason. I asked if he was the manager since his behavior was bizarre, and he confirmed that he was. He told me the pork came from his grandfather’s farm somewhere upstate, as if I should inherently know this.\n\nLook, I’m not against risky food. I just have this radical idea that I should personally decide what I’m eating and how much risk I’d like to take at any given moment. After going back and forth with this extremely rude guy, I finally told him that I just wanted to watch the game and that the bill was fine. He did not let it go and continued arguing with me, insisting that he was right and I was wrong. At this point, I might have pointed out that he was being unreasonably rude. We weren’t trying to avoid paying our bill, but some acknowledgment would have been nice. As soon as my husband interrupted and said what I had already repeated at least five times—that we weren’t able to see the rawness around the bone due to the dim lighting at the bar—we were comped almost half of the bill. We hadn’t even asked for that and had repeatedly told them not to comp us for the food.\n\nRegardless, the food was absolutely amazing, along with the service, which I even mentioned to the manager/chef. But I personally don’t like being treated as a nuisance for pointing out a mess up on their end. We both enjoyed the food so much, and it’s really a shame that our night ended on such a bad note for absolutely no reason. Needless to say, won’t be back."

            "text": "Ilis was highly recommended to us by a friend who is a chef, after we asked about suggestions on restaurants in New York that truly push boundaries. It did not disappoint. While we are quite familiar with the concept of radical local sourcing and seasonal cooking organised by colder and warmer days, (yes, days not months), Ilis still managed to surprise us. We opted for the market menu, which is tailored to the ingredients available on that very day, and were treated to an additional dish. Each course was impeccably well prepared and presented effortlessly, and fun! The natural taste of the ingredients was allowed to shine, offering the rare opportunity to unspoil your palate and rediscover how herbs, vegetables, and meat/fish taste on their own, when not suffocated in fat, sugar, and spices. This, we believe, is the key to the success of Ilis and its chef Mads Refslund: being able to keep the dishes almost naked while never  loosing the culinary direction. An absolute standout was the extra dish: raw tuna scraped from the dorsal fin spine, followed by the other side grilled with sesame. It was nothing short of a feast! Another memorable feature is Ilis' book of ingredients, which you can browse through between courses. It offers insight into their sourcing, philosophy, food preferences, and quirks (giggle). Lastly, the open kitchen is from another orbit, with its wood-fired charcoal oven, open barbecues, and dedicated adjacent fish and meat smoking stations. We could rave on and on about it. Very special place, which easily deserves six stars."

My husband and I had to select the same 4 , which was a discussion, but we landed in a delicious place :). My only feedback is that because the chefs are the ones to talk about each course and they rotate, there was a bit of inconsistency on the instruction / description. Everyone was wonderful but one guy made it a bit confusing"

Unfortunately, while the food was good, it wasn’t great and didn’t live up to the $325 per person tasting menu price tag. Many dishes lacked wow factor and punch, though inventive and visually stunning. Service, on the whole, was world-class, with one exception that was quickly remedied - my wife’s scallop dish was grainy, gritty and the crunch of sand destroyed the delicate texture I enjoyed - one server explained that “this happens” and that there was nothing they could do about it. Our main server was aghast at the initial explanation and immediately took steps to try to make it right, while guaranteeing that the kitchen would never deem this acceptable. The space is immaculate and beautiful, airy and bright, and was totally unexpected before stepping in from the street."

We had tried to walk in during their soft opening week and didn’t realize it wasn’t totally open yet, so Will helped us with our reservation. We were so happy to see him again during our dinner.\n\nWe had the 12 course tasting menu, which was a significant amount of food, so if you’re not a big eater maybe opt for the 7 course. Very seafood forward which I absolutely loved. Everything was delicious. Wine pairings are offered, but having read great reviews about the cocktails, we skipped that. Cocktails are minimalistically presented, but flavours speak for themselves. I was rolling over full by the time dessert came around, which was slightly underwhelming, maybe a warm dessert would be a nice touch.\n\nSome earlier reviews mentioned service issues and slow serving times.

For $800+ it would’ve been nice if the staff acted more interested and added to the experience. But they were more on the shy and quiet side albeit very nice and professional nonetheless.\n\nThe organized chaos in the kitchen was a vibe. Love that you barely noticed them but you know they’re hustling in there. The beginning plates were all very normal, nothing spectacular about the flavors.\n\nMy gazpacho straw didn’t work 🤷🏽‍♀️ and the grilled fish was totally meh. The sashimi side was delightful though but it was almost forgotten as we overheard someone mention it and made sure to ask our waiter if we were supposed to get it as well. By dish 6 it started getting more exciting. Really tasty and fun plates towards the end.\n\nI read people talking about a la carte and maybe that would’ve been the way to go for a lot less $.

The completely open kitchen is a real treat, allowing you to see how the staff bring everything together. Sitting at the bar gives you a front row seat to this spectacle, which is where we (a party of 4) sat. For those who don’t like sitting at the bar, this bar is different. Plenty of space (deep counters) and they do a great job spacing everyone out so you don’t have to shout to be heard.\n\nWe did the Field Guide tasting menu, and 2 of us did the wine pairing (which was excellent) and one of us did the non-alcoholic beverage pairing. Instead of just zero proof cocktails, the nonalcoholic pairing was made of interesting nonalcoholic wines, which I appreciated. The food was phenomenal, inventive and beautifully plated (the bowl for one of the dishes was made entirely of ice!). My absolute favorites were the Brussels sprouts “on the cob” and the whole fish! My only complaint about the fish is that I wish they had given each person their own fish, rather than giving one fish for every two persons. I also ordered a couple things a la carte: an oyster and a drink that was inside of a squash. The oyster was great but I could’ve done without the squash drink.\n\nThe price is steep, but on par for restaurants of this nature. One person in our party said he could do with a slice of pizza after the meal, because he was still hungry. The rest of us were fine, but not stuffed. So I recommend not coming here super hungry.\n\nOverall, I’m so glad I got a chance to try this place, and can’t wait for my next visit!"

Sitting at the bar provides a front-row seat to the restaurant’s unique kitchen, where chefs work seamlessly amidst a visually stunning dining area. The presentation of each dish is a masterpiece, served on creative dishware crafted from shells or clams, adding to the overall ambiance. The flavors are a delightful fusion of various cuisines, with an abundance of fresh herbs that elevate every bite, tantalizing the palate with their natural essence. I’m already planning my next visit to experience the table sitting, where I can select from a diverse array of ingredients displayed nearby. Ilis truly offers a dining experience like no other!"

The ambiance, the open kitchen concept, the table side food prep and drink prep was one of the most amazing experiences that we’ve had.\n\nWe started off by being greeted by our server in which the Bar Director (Bobby Murphy) greeted us at our table and asked more questions about the type of Vodka we’d like in our martini’s. We essentially told him we trusted his decision making and thank god we did because the martini he made for us was amazing. Bobby also prepared table side espresso martinis after our dinner which was pretty amazing as well.\n\nMy Wife and I chose the 5 course option, although the food was so amazing, a part of me wishes we would have elected the 7 course. All of the dishes were prepared perfectly and were dishes you will never have experienced and you will never experience anything else like it. This restaurant won the best restaurant of 2023 for a reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a burger, fries and a bill under $200, this is not the place for you. If you are open to paying the appropriate amount for an outstanding culinary experience and evening, I can’t recommend this place enough."

            "text": "For the price we paid, ILIS was a disappointment. The food was quite good, but at close to $500 per person after everything, we felt like it wasn't worth it. My wife and I got the Field Guide with the Wine pairing and initially were very excited. ILIS even gives you an actual guide book explaining a bit of the story of each dish we were going to get. However the guide was likely for the previous season's menu as it was completely unrelated to anything we ate, not a big deal but unfortunate regardless.\n\nWe chose the pheasant as the main entree and it was very disappointing. The presentation looked really nice, but it was completely dry and unimpressive. The pumpkin served with soup inside it was supposed to be cooked so you could scrape the pumpkin into the soup, but the pumpkin was basically uncooked. To their credit, we did mention this to the staff and they replaced the pumpkin for us, and the proper dish was quite tasty. They also gave us both a free Carajillo cocktail, which was very good. However this wasn't just us, some friends there the same night also said their Pheasant wasn't good and didn't even finish it.\n\nThere were some definite highlights, like the wine pairing, Deer Tartare Dumplings and their two desserts, but we left disappointed given the expectations based on the price and the hype. If this was a $100-200 meal per person total it would be fine, but not at this price.\n\nAdditionally we felt like they relied too much on the quality of their ingredients (admittedly very high quality) and not on the cooking. The only thing that really blew us away was the Deer Tartare dumplings."

            "text": "I recently visited ILIS, a newly opened restaurant in Brooklyn. The restaurant's culinary style is Scandinavian, influenced by the renowned Noma, and features seasonal plants, seafood, and game from North America. This unique combination makes ILIS stand out among New York restaurants. Despite being located in a less convenient area of Brooklyn, the restaurant excels in food taste, dish presentation, and overall service, perfectly aligning with the Michelin three-star description of an 'exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey.'\n\nSeveral aspects of the restaurant left a deep impression:\n1. The restaurant follows the farm-to-table concept but goes beyond the ordinary, reaching a 'nature-to-table' level. They source ingredients from nature, including those overlooked by many farms, providing a taste experience uncommon in regular restaurants.\n\n2. The presentation of dishes is exceptional, utilizing seafood shells and plant-based containers as utensils, enhancing the overall taste experience.\n\n3. The cafeteria operates smoothly, with a clear separation between cold and hot food areas, ensuring food safety and peace of mind for diners enjoying cold dishes.\n\n4. Both servers and chefs are enthusiastic about preparing and introducing dishes. Their positive service helps customers have a comfortable dining experience, showcasing their knowledge and passion for their work.\n\n5. The restaurant has perfect lighting with a Nordic cool-toned yet warm atmosphere. The background music complements the ambiance well, maintaining an ideal volume.\n\nHowever, being a newly opened restaurant, there are areas for improvement:\n1. The pace of serving dishes is slow. Opting for the Field Guide menu took a total of 3.5 hours, which might be too long for those with other evening plans. Some cold dishes had intervals of over half an hour, making the wait for the next course a bit tedious. Shortening the dining time to 2-2.5 hours could provide a more coherent taste experience and allow the restaurant to accommodate more guests in one evening.\n\n2. The restaurant does not provide a printed menu after the meal. While chefs and servers announce the dishes, having a printed menu for guests to take as a keepsake would be a nice addition.\n\n3. The Field Guide menu predominantly features seafood, lacking variety in meats and vegetables. Adding a couple of options like beef, venison, and poultry, along with fresh vegetables as accompaniments to seafood dishes or preparing seaweed as a vegetarian option, might enhance the taste experience.\n\n4. The desserts are overly simple, and all are milk-based, resulting in some repetition. Introducing a solid dessert, such as cake, chocolate, or fruit, alongside the existing liquid milk-based dessert, could add variety.\n\nIn conclusion, ILIS is a highly impressive restaurant, and as a new establishment, the areas for improvement only increase the anticipation for the next dining experience."

Everything was timed perfectly and service was professional and informative without being intrusive. The food was excellent. We had the field guide menu and left full but not overly so. We added in the premier wine pairing and were very pleased with it. There were a lot of interesting and perfectly paired selections. I’d caution diners that unless you purely stick to the prepaid menu, you will likely spend a lot here. In my opinion, all of the add ons were absolutely worth it. I’ve dined at Noma and while the quality is the same, this meal was more approachable and less exotic (in a good way). Highly recommend… most suitable for a special occasion ."

Very original and great flavour and texture.\n\nWe enjoyed the experience overall and we are glad that we tried the restaurant. Don’t think it’s a place that we will repeat though"

The concepts were interesting, featuring lots of bitter/earthy elements complemented by tart/citrus notes, but execution was hit or miss.\n\nWhile some courses like the scallops in the ice bowl and trout with cabbage were delightful and balanced sweetness, brine, citrus, spice, earthiness and texture, the smoked salmon was the opposite - smoky and salty notes stacked on top of each other to the point of being inedible.\n\nWhile the brussel sprouts \"on the cob\" were presented in an interesting way and cooked well, I could not taste any material difference compared to regular brussel sprouts. It feels like I could have done something very similar at home with skewers, some seasoning, and a grill (I certainly wouldn't claim this for some of the other dishes that were served).\n\nMy $18 urchin add-on had barely any urchin in it, mostly just foam.\n\nThe cocktails and the dessert, however, were excellent and well balanced. Loved the ice cream with the finger lime. For ~$275 all in though, I expected to be blown away and unfortunately wasn't"

The space and the vibe are SOOOO amazing and the staff is perfection. I dined solo and asked to be seated at the chef's counter which I highly recommend (even for couples). Not only was each and every person I interacted with super knowledgeable about the food, they were also kind and friendly and welcoming. Please note that I would never describe myself as a highly experimental diner but I more than enjoyed every element of the 12-course dinner.  My favorites included all the eel dishes (I'm a huge fan) plus the antelope and the duck. So while I may NOT crave any particular dish, I definitely crave the experience Mads and his team have created at ILIS - and I will be back for that extraordinary vibe and ambiance and overall experience."

I could see how some people might though.\n\nthere was also no carbs- which for a carb person, is a little tough.

She also did not appear to have known about the restriction beforehand, which made us feel like she did not even bother reading the note, and reassured us the scallop aversion isn’t an issue. Then guess what, I still got served scallops! One apology, and 10 minutes of waiting later, they brought over a carrot soup. This isn’t a big issue but this shouldn’t be happening at a restaurant charging close to $400 per person. Also thankfully, it wasn’t an allergy.\n\nWe also did not leave with a menu explaining the food we ate or list of wines we got to try, which is the norm for restaurants of this price point and caliber. There also were no snacks/treats to take home (also customary of restaurants in this price point) and no add ons to the menu (or we weren’t made of aware of such options). Our check was dropped on the table the moment our desserts were taken away (as in our server with the check was right behind the other server taking away our plates), which we also don’t experience often… usually, the check is brought over when asked.\n\nWe also started off with ordering 2 cocktails that never came and our server completely forgot about.\n\nFood: Honestly, it was OK. Nothing tasted bad but nothing was outrageously impressive either. The antelope was interesting and we appreciated the eel, but nothing was innovative, which we expected based on the founder being a Noma alum.\n\nWe aren’t people with big appetites but we found ourselves not stuffed to the brim, which also is not the norm for us at these kinds of restaurants. If they had not given us the bread course, we would likely be still hungry afterwards. We could imagine some people could leave hungry.\n\nWine pairing: phenomenal and we really appreciated the inclusion of sakes, which paired really well with the seafood-heavy menu. Highlight of our meal.\n\nSpace:\nThe space is gorgeous. High-end Brooklyn warehouse vibes, very different from the other similar fine dining experiences in the city (comparing mostly to Aska, also in Brooklyn and Scandinavian).\n\nSummary: It was OK - but it was too expensive and the backgrounds of the founders are too impressive to be just OK. It should’ve been phenomenal, and it COULD have been. Hope this review helps them do better because I really want this place to succeed. Our other friends have tried the cheaper menu (Market Menu) at $195 and had a better experience. You even get a fun activity of choosing your ingredients, which the Field Menu does not provide. I think we would’ve left happier if we had done that, as nothing in the Field Menu made it feel like we had pay the premium for a reason. I would love to come back and try their cocktail experience, as it reminds me of Aviary, but I would skip their dining experience for now."
