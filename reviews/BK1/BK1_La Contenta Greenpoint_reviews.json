Sometimes they even have live music, which makes it even more special.\nRoberto is hands down the most hospitable person I’ve ever met — he made the whole experience feel like we were guests in his home. We had so much fun!\nAnd the food… wow. We tried guacamole, shrimp tacos, salmon, another shrimp dish, and honestly every single thing was incredible. I couldn’t even pick a favorite because it was all so delicious. And the non alcoholic margaritas are amazing!!!\nHighly recommend — we’re already planning to come back! 🌮💃"

Our cocktails were awesome and the guac was very good but the tacos were to die for. The pescado tacos were packed with flavor and the steak tacos were an absolute show-stealer, just perfectly cooked meat and a wonderful sauce. The service was also warm and fast. Excited to have this gem in the neighborhood!"
