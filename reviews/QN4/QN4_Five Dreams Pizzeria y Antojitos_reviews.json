But when we went to go buy a large cheese pie, it was cold, the slices weren’t even cut properly and it looked really low quality. Not worth the amount I paid for🤦‍♂️."

            "text": "HIGHLY UNDERRATED AND LOCAL HOLE IN THE WALL MEXICAN FUSION PIZZA!!!\n\nSuper small space BUT BIG ON FLAVOR.\n\nOrdered a $13 - SPLIT flavor personal pie with mole (mole sauce, chicken, sesame seeds, spicy peanuts) and al pastor (spicy pork, pineapple, red onions & cilantro)\n\nPrice was amazing. Personal pie can feed 2. I am a big eater and can eat alot. I could not finish the pie. The neopolitan pizza crust was chefs kiss. It had great bite and chew texture. I loved it. Other reviews here are SPOT ON with the flavor and overall pizza enjoyment.\n\nGot a jicama drink for $5. Lightly sweetened. Great product made in house as well.\n\nDEFINITELY A MUST TRY! SUGGEST YOU CARRY OUT AS THE SEATING IS NOT OPTIMAL.\n\nI wish them great success and hopefully better / bigger seating one day!"

The owners are very kind, and the pizza is top notch! It's thin with a crispy crust, and they're not stingy with the toppings at all. You can tell this pizza is made with love. The pizza is also made very quick, I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes for a pie. Also love the exposed brick that gives the place its charm. There are no actual tables but there are high top chairs and you can sit at the bar to eat. Overall, 5/5! I hope this place stays in business forever."
