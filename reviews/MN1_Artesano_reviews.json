We were seated quickly and enjoyed the cozy, quiet, beautifully decorated ambience.\n\nThe first few courses were stellar: The Artesano Ceviche was everything a classic mixto should be and had plenty of seafood variety, tiger's milk, choclo and sweet potato. The Pulpo al Olivo arrived nicely chewy with a unique accompaniment of tapioca crisps.\n\nThe entrees were where the inexperience started to show. I will say that our Branzino a La Parrilla was perfectly cooked, but the accompanying aji panca marinade seemed like overkill and was largely unnecessary when you already have a sauced and grilled fish that well done. The spring salad was nice, though, and not too tart.\n\nThe Mushroom Chifero was a huge disappointment. I was hoping for some true Peruvian-Chinese innovation (a la modern chifa), but this was mostly just large-grained sticky rice with roasted maitake mushrooms that were ruined by a completely unnecessary sweet and tart tamarind sauce. It felt like, in the interest of being creative and unique, they decided to throw in a fruit sauce to stir things up--but what is the point of serving a fried rice dish with fried garlic, scallions and mushrooms if you're just going to drown it in tamarind?\n\nI didn't want to order this but was convinced to get aside dish of Truffle Yuca Fries. They were fine, but the truffle flavor was weak and they really needed the accompanying huancaina sauce to import any flavor. I get that yuca is a pretty flavorless starch vegetable, which is why I didn't really want to pay $18 (yes, $18) for this side dish.\n\nAfter the entrees, the service team dropped the ball harder than Aaron Rodgers last month in Dublin. We waited at least 20 min, but no one came to clear our plates, check on us or ask if we wanted dessert. By this time, the restaurant had filled up and the vibe had turned distinctly clubby: my geriatric ears could hardly hear anything over the thunderous bass of DJ Whats-His-Face and MC Who-Knows-That.\n\nWhen we finally flagged down a server, ordered dessert and finished it, well....it wasn't worth the hassle. I forget the name of the dessert, but it was Choclo something and featured corn sponge cake, corn mousse, chulpi praline, and mango gel. The sponge cake had perfect texture but barely any corn flavor. The corn mousse was lovely, but the mango gel overwhelmed it and felt unnecessary.\n\nWhen we paid and left, no one acknowledged us or thanked us. Guess they couldn't hear us through the pulsating beats. All in all, a tepid finish to a promising start.",
