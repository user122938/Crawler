Quick 8-10 min walk from the Dumbo ferry point.\nWe ordered a platter where you can choose any of the 5 dips/ salads. They serve it with Pitas that are freshly made and are seriously fluffy and fresh.\nThey do serve spirits and we took a bottle of Wine for the table - worked well for us.\nWe ordered Shish kebabs - comes with dips and pita … and a veggie 10’ Pitza which was a Mediterranean take on pizza - simple ingredients … and very tasty.\nGood smiling servers with great energy.\nWould go there again."

And when I say the food is delicious I mean literally everything! There is not one thing I wouldn’t recommend. They never disappoint. Even the atmosphere and seating is just so beautiful. The prices are also unbelievably affordable for such good food! This is a restaurant I would recommend to anyone even if they didn’t like Mediterranean food because they have something for everyone and nothing is neglected. Such an amazing place that’s worth many visits not just one."

The order process was not smooth because it got canceled and duplicated when we were picking up our order.\n\nThe staff was friendly but not familiar with the issues caused by Grubhub which was frustrating. It was fixed in the end by Grubhub but was time-consuming.\n\nWe had their Green Pitza, Leg of Lamb Plate and Baklava. The food was decent especially the leg of lamb. The lamb was cooked properly with no gamey taste even my husband who hates lamb finished his plate.\n\nWe were disappointed with their baklava which was not the best in our experience and the filling was way too little."

Nice enough guy, but it's too busy to keep up any service.\n\nTry the Loomi, it's excellent!\n\nNothing stellar about the food or the presentation. The fresh pita was a nice addition, and the rice was good as well. The lamb was fresh enough, but a little overcooked and not seasoned as much as I'm used to when I'm in the Middle East. The flat wide skewer normally used for an Adana kebab was absent, so I got a round hotdog lamb stick. Fair enough, just different. The mixed salad had hardly any dressing, if any. At least it was fresh and diced small.\n\nThe mixed appetizer was a small portion and not worth the price to me. The onion chickpea side was a new one and not that appealing. I'm guessing that it is sumac on the pickled beats?\n\nI'm being a little rough on this restaurant, but I expected better in NYC. Comparing it to every other Middle Eastern restaurant in the US only, I probably should give it 2.5 stars.\n\nWould I return? No\nIs it worth a stop? Meh..."
