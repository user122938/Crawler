I was appalled but the food was already dished  out so I'm like ok I'll just take it. I got home and shared the food between myself and my boyfriend. The food was EXTREMELY salty. And not flavorful. You know when a cook over salts the food to try to compensate for flavor. Yes, that. Not only was it expensive for Spanish food it didn't taste good. I'd never buy food from here again. I was better off going a few blocks down to where ATB cab station is and gotten food from the restaurant on that block. Never Again !!!\n\nNew Owners - They are NOT associated with  La Lechonera (The Old Owners)"

I was very embarrassed. He made it seem as if i gave him a fake bill. A woman worker tried to mediate by saying i could pay next time, but i went back and got another bill, which they still questioned b/c it had some grease on it, but not as much as the 1st one. They eventually took the money, but needless to say my experience there was uncomfortable. I have been a customer for for over 10 years and never experienced this. Needless to say i wont be back."
