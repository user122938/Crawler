The team happily refired it, delivering a dreamingly tender cut with a deep pink blush. Beautiful piece of meat in the end, and they even took it off our check. Thanks for being on top of it. Duck was beautiful too.\n\nCan't wait to come back for another neighborhood meal."

The dim lights and the restaurant's aesthetic are very chic and quaint.\n\nThe food doesn't disappoint. We got the chicken pate for an appetizer, which didn’t look appetizing, but it was pretty good. We also got the fries, which were hot and crispy. The menu is seasonal, but the pork shoulder must be their signature dish since I got the same thing years ago, which is my go-to meal here. My boyfriend got the duck. They were okay, kind of hard to chew, a bit tough, even though the flavor is there.\n\nWe didn’t have enough room for dessert, but the last time I was here, I tried their olive chocolate cake. I 100% recommend it.\n\nFor drinks, I would choose their wine options. I’m not a big fan of their cocktails."

When we arrived, they had already given our table away. We were seated fairly quickly though, but the hostess had an attitude. Ok we are late 10 minutes but keep it professional instead of saying “we are too busy to pick up the phone”.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. The pancakes were too heavy and nothing to be excited about. The chips and aioli were okay.\n\nOur waitress was nice, though.\n\nOverall overpriced and overhyped."

I’m not the type of person who writes bad reviews at all, but in this case, I’d like to share my experience. Because I hate spend money with bad food.\n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes, we finally got a table, excited to try the famous pancakes and a few other things. Besides the pancakes, we ordered bacon, eggs, and a quiche.\n\nThe pancakes were okay and worth trying, but they were missing something to complement them — like jelly or some fresh fruit — because they only came with butter and syrup, nothing new or extraordinary.\n\nThe eggs and bacon were extremely oily, and I couldn’t eat everything. I only ate the eggs because I was very hungry and didn’t want to look for another place to eat.\n\nI really wanted to come here and give a good review, but unfortunately, that was not my experience."

Devo dire di essere rimasto in parte deluso dato che ho trovato il gusto dei pancakes alquanto salato e con un persistente sapore di lievito. Consigli comunque di provarli anche per avere un termine di paragone con altri famosi ristoranti di New York che servono pancake. Molto buone la shakshuka con uova in camicia. Seconda tazza di caffè offerta dalla casa, non scontento dato che molti ristoranti fanno pagare per ogni refill. Ambiente piccolo e privo di aria condizionata. Servizio attento e rapidissimo (tempo di attesa di circa 3 minuti fra l’ordinazione e la presentazione dei piatti). Prenotazione consigliata."

The menu is very basic, with nothing standing out aside from the pancakes - that was the main reason we decided to give this place a try. The pancakes looked amazing, but they were insanely greasy. I had a quarter piece and just couldn’t eat more.\n\nThe fried green tomato was recommended by our waitress, but it was also underwhelming - definitely not worth $20 if you ask me. The waitress came to our table a few times to ask if she could clear plates, but eventually she just started taking away our utensils without saying anything. We were left with food on the table but nothing to eat it with.\n\nI get that it was close to their midday closing time, but there’s definitely a better way to handle that if you’re trying to move people along."

            "text": "Ich hatte große Erwartungen an unseren Abend bei Chez Ma Tante – nicht zuletzt, weil es ein besonderer Anlass war: Ich hatte meine Eltern seit über einem Jahr nicht mehr gesehen und wollte ihnen mit einem schönen Essen eine Freude machen. Leider wurde daraus ein durchweg enttäuschendes Erlebnis, bei dem vor allem das Verhältnis von Preis und Leistung absolut nicht stimmte.\n\nBereits die Ankunft verlief holprig. Obwohl ich die Reservation 1,5 Wochen im Voraus gemacht hatte und wir pünktlich um 19:45 Uhr eintrafen, mussten wir bis 20:00 Uhr warten, da alle Tische noch besetzt waren. Auf der Website wird ausdrücklich darauf hingewiesen, dass Gäste bei Verspätung mit Mehrkosten rechnen müssen – umgekehrt scheint dieser Anspruch jedoch nicht zu gelten. Außer einer dreimaligen Entschuldigung kam vom Personal keinerlei Entgegenkommen – kein Aperitif, kein Amuse-Bouche, nicht einmal ein kleiner Gruß aus der Küche als Zeichen des Bedauerns.\n\nDie Vorspeisen waren solide, wenn auch nicht überragend. Der Country Paté war geschmacklich gut, wurde aber ohne Brot serviert - etwas ungewöhnlich. Die Oliven hingegen waren hervorragend und rückblickend leider das kulinarische Highlight des Abends.\n\nBei den Hauptspeisen ließ die Küche lange auf sich warten. Nach fast 30 Minuten wurde uns erneut versichert, dass das Essen \"in fünf Minuten\" komme – was es dann auch tat, allerdings mit weiteren Enttäuschungen. Die Forelle war geschmacklich super, kam aber nur lauwarm auf den Tisch. Das Steak war zwar gut gebraten, aber insgesamt sehr übersichtlich portioniert. Das größte Ärgernis war jedoch das Hähnchen: Es bestand größtenteils aus Knochen und Knorpel, begleitet von drei traurigen Brokkolistangen und einer total wässrigen, ebenfalls lauwarmen Sauce. Eine derart lieblos wirkende Präsentation und Zubereitung hätte ich in einem Restaurant dieser Preisklasse nicht erwartet.\n\nEinziger Lichtblick war der Wein, der wirklich gut war – was aber den insgesamt enttäuschenden Abend nicht retten konnte. Bei einer Rechnung von knapp 300 Dollar für drei Personen war das Erlebnis den Preis in keiner Weise wert. Noch eine Entschuldigung mehr hätte da auch nichts bewirkt.\n\nIch kann dieses Restaurant leider nicht empfehlen und würde definitiv nicht noch einmal hingehen."

It's not a cocktail.\nWe had to ask about some missing oysters and got a very curt \"all the food you ordered is coming\" in response. I guess either we were lied to by the server or the kitchen really intended to send oysters as dessert, which would be absurd.\nJust be honest. Stuff gets forgotten. It happens and its understandable. Lying with a bad tone isn't.\nNice, bright room with big windows perfect for enjoying a daytime meal while enjoying Greenpoint."

The only edible portion was the center and they’re made of cornmeal so it was akin to lightly flavored cornbread.\nAlso worst take on shakshuka I’ve ever encountered though the sourdough bread read that accompanied it was great. The cured salmon and crème fraiche were tasty tho ruined with copious amounts of olive oil.\nWould have been a horrible start to the day if their kombucha wasn’t so good."

I was fortunate to make a reservation only two days prior. The staff here are cordial, respectful and very convivial. Friendly to a fault. They balance the right amount of attentiveness and when to lay back. I am always (and still surprised) at how delicious the pancakes are. The hummus plate is a MUST! I’ve had the quiche previously (last year). A few of the breakfast sandwiches. I’ve been saving (hopefully) the best for last…the biscuits and gravy. Every time I see it on a menu my fingers are 🤞 crossed!! Hoping they meet my expectations!!! When I am asked by my friends, family and co-workers where they should try for brunch? In my top three, Chez is there. I’m not going to let my other gatekeeps be known here, suffice to say I always want to be a Chez, but if I can’t grab a resy here, I’ll opt for the other two. For everyone else who wants to try Chez, get your 100 Yard Dash shoes on! On Your Mark…🏃🏻🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️"

            "text": "「Update: June 29th 2029」：The worst dining experience.\n\nThis was our favorite place to have brunch until this visit. We sit indoor under a speaker which was blasting whatever music it was playing. It was so loud that everyone in the restaurant had to yelled to each other and competed with the speakers to be able to let the other people to hear what one is saying. We kindly asked two waitresses to help lower the volume, but no, the volume got up and the whole place got louder. One of them asked us to sit outdoor next time so it won’t be this loud… lol, what a great attitude; basically what she meant was “it’s not our fault it’s your fault.” So unfortunately, the only thing I can do is to leave a one star (it was five stars before) and I’m sure the restaurant won’t care either. However, if you love loud party in the morning and lunch, I’m sure you would love to be there.\n.\n.\nThe review from a few years ago:\nhere and found out this is quite a surprise with good food, friendly people and chill vibe. The pancake is exceptional! Must order!"

We shared an appetizer (French fries with aioli sauce) and two “salads”: stracciatella and felafal. Not exactly the most exciting choices. Ended the meal with a share slice of key lime pie that was so uninteresting that between the two of us we didn’t even finish it. We had a bottle of  Sauvignon blanc plus two glasses. And we paid $100 EACH including tip.\n\nI had a lovely evening because of the company but the restaurant in itself was just  a functional setting. Maybe more interesting for brunch?"

A slice of Quiche ($22), biscuits and gravy ($27), and the egg sandwich ($19) are only real options for a brunch. For that price I would expect each to come with a side salad at the very least. They don’t even cook the eggs in the sandwich made to order. It’s a glorified egg & cheese mcmuffin with a steamed egg and brioche bun (that I doubt they even make on site). Sausage is another $5. If you wanted a fresh side salad, there’s not even the option. They only have a drenched caesar salad that would be a separate order.\n\nThere needs to be a better brunch menu and the place is so stingy. Iced tea & cold brew were served in a tiny glass filled with ice and they don’t offer any refills."

The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming — we felt right at home the moment we walked in. Thanks to the rainy day, we lucked out with three seats at the bar without any wait — a true blessing in NYC!\n\nWe flew in for a long weekend, and this spot was at the top of our list, largely due to the buzz surrounding Chef Oscar Paz and his now-legendary pancakes and pig face recipe. Let me just say — it absolutely did not disappoint.\n\nThe pancakes transported me straight back to my childhood — warm memories of my grandmother’s kitchen came rushing back with every bite. I couldn’t help but smile. The pancakes were cooked to perfection with a welcoming hint of lemon zest. The pig face  Exquisite and unlike anything I’ve ever tasted. Chef Oscar deserves a standing ovation for these dishes alone.\n\nWe also tried the homemade biscuit, which   made a jar of jam taste like a treasured family secret.\n\nBetween the food, service, and pricing — everything was top tier. Whether you’re a visitor or a Brooklyn local, do your palate a favor and make Chez Ma Tante a priority, You’ll walk away planning your return."

The food wasn’t timed right however, my sandwich came out right away but I waited about 15 min for my pancake to come out and I wanted to eat them together but I did not get to do that. The pancake was nice and crispy and buttery. I tasted a nutty or maybe fruity note to them, perhaps from the butter toasting during the cooking process. The egg sandwich with bacon was quite good and the caramelized onions made it quite rich. I’d go back to try the biscuit. I did not appreciate the lack of non alcoholic drink options, I’d have liked more juices or a few mocktails.

The pancakes are the best you’ll ever have but don’t let that stop you from exploring the rest of the menu because everything we’ve tried is exceptional (the only thing that’s remotely mediocre is their black coffee). Absolutely make a reservation ahead for brunch unless you want to wait multiple hours. We go out of our way to visit every time we’re in NY and it has not disappointed!"

I’m always a little worried about a decrease in quality after place closes for a bit due to construction issues or whatever but I’m happy to report this place is still perfect. Get the skate 😭💖"

Slightly crispy on the outside and so fluffy on the inside, with a bit of a citrusy flavour. So nice to visit a place that lives up to its hype. Very friendly service too and a nice atmosphere."

            "text": "We came for the pancakes, and the pancakes were delicious! I’m not a huge fan of pancakes, but my girlfriend loves them, thus I have been eating quite a lot of pancakes recently. These had an essence of lemon and were wonderfully fluffy, but the best feature was the crisp they held. That crisp made each bite my favorite bite. The syrup was quite good as well, wasn’t overly sweet and had a slightly complex flavor which I appreciated, but the pancakes soak it all up quite quickly so you sort of need a lot of it. Overall, are they  very special? No, not really, but that’s kind of what makes them special. It’s like having the very best version possible of homemade pancakes available to you without any of the hassle of making them. They are the truest version of what pancakes are, no bells and whistles, no fancy compote or sugary toppings. This feature sets them aside from other restaurants, these pancakes don’t need to try so hard because the fundamentals are so perfected.\n\nWe also enjoyed the quiche, which had a slightly thicker and well done crust than I would have preferred, but the flavor was bold and was a welcome palate reliever from the sweet pancakes. The side salad also notably paired beautifully with the quiche.\n\nOverall a wonderful brunch :)"

            "text": "From the first bite, I knew these were going to be the best pancakes I’ve eaten. Nothing else comes close. The pancakes taste almost deep-fried, like those donuts with a sturdy shell, full of flavors from browning. Even though there’s no visible liquid on the plate, the pancakes feel saturated with butter and syrup, sweet but not too sweet. It was extremely rich and cloying. Yet, I wanted every last bit. Coffee helps.\n\nChez Ma Tante has been around for six years, so I’m late to the party, but this feels innovative and boundary-pushing without being gimmicky. I never would have imagined pancakes like these based on the ones I’ve eaten in the past. It takes knowledge and creativity to *invent* something like this. Hopefully this style of pancake fully takes off and appears across the globe."

Chicken was really good, crispy skin, juicy and flavorful...but kind of disappointed that it was just chicken and no sides for that price (29$). It would be great with broccoli and mash potatoes or something, but it's still good.  My waitress was Sabrina, she was professional, and I had great service. Thank you."

The food was light yet filling at the same time, with the pancakes having the perfect balance of crisp first-bites and satisfying fluffy flavor. The quiche was soft and easy to get into, each layer was distinct yet crafted a cohesive flavorful experience. The fresh juices were refreshing and the staff welcoming and friendly. Overall, could not have had a better start to the morning than with our brunch here. I will say the location is a bit far from the nearest subway station, but well worth the walk in every aspect."
