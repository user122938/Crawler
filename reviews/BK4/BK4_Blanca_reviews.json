Most of the protein was seafood based, and frankly the beef dishes were our least favorite of the evening. Perhaps because I was getting full and they were at the end. Really glorious meal! Only Blanca pre-pandemic and a couple of meals in Japan for our honeymoon rival it!"

The food was not so bad to say the best , I can’t even remember what they served ,totally unforgettable …. New chef Blamey wasn’t there .

            "text": "In short, food was not commensurate to the price point. No particularly delicious nor memorable dishes and at the same cost I’ve had stellar meals at places like Odo and Oiji Mi.\n\nThe house staff were nice. The wine pairing was the best part of the meal. What really soured me was when a particular dish which was to be served then topped with consommé came to us, we didn’t catch that we were supposed to wait for the consommé. It arrived several minutes after the dish was served. So we ate, and finished it, before then. We were not bothered, it was a fine dish anyway. Whether or not we were told this and missed it, or were not told it, is really beside the point, as we had no complaints.\n\nThe issue was, when chef came to top with consommé she was understandably bothered. But instead of being gracious or taking it in stride, her dour attitude was immediately palpable and she left curtly. One of the hosts soon returned to serve us the soup separately. At this point all I or my wife had said was, literally, “sorry” (though, what did we have to be sorry for?). Unfortunately instead of saying anything remotely accountable, he basically said “chef was so mad at me, but I’m sure I told you to wait!” At that point I started to feel more like an employee than a guest. Sorry but, did I eat the food I payed for wrong? Is that my fault? Then, to make an awkward situation unforgivable, while serving the next dish to the party before us, chef mentioned to take care as it was hot enough to scald. Then she notes, while chatting with them, how so many reviews have mentioned that this particular dish is served too hot, and despite her warning, people still complain. Fine I guess, but, shouldn’t you know how to serve food at the right temperature? Maybe as the one in control you should do your part such that the problem can’t exist, and you aren’t creating the potential for an undesirable outcome? It sounded familiar. Then as she serves us, while still speaking to them, she says “some people just don’t listen”. That sent me.\n\nI do not work for you. For something to go wrong and you offer pleas of innocence directly to me, let alone make me feel somehow guilty for it, is the most antithetical and absurd thing I have ever encountered during a meal. I felt like I was in a TV show. Put your ego away. I don’t care. I can say with certainty that whatever fuss was made over this non-incident, had the soup been added [at the time of service, as it should have been…], it would have had no effect on the dish. Not only did it not matter, and was not an issue until the chef made it one and terrified the staff into shirking responsibility, it was absurd to blame me.\n\nUltimately the amount I paid compared to the meal I ate and the experience I had was upsetting. Even outside of this, I was underwhelmed by the menu and would not recommend it if you’re looking for a great meal. The seafood dishes failed to highlight the best qualities of each protein, generally being overwhelmingly oceanic — some unpleasantly so, such as the oysters and skipjack. The chard, despite its sauce, was just chard, chewy and vegetal. The bread, empanadas, and aged pork were the only tasty items, of which only the bread was standout.\n\nBasically the food was ok, experience surreal, and overall, this place at best made me appreciate the other fine dining experiences I’ve had even more."

            "text": "I had the pleasure of dining  here a few weeks ago.\nBlanca provides a dining experience that is both groundbreaking and extraordinary, with each dish showcasing an exceptional blend of creativity and precision. The culinary team pushes the limits of innovation, employing cutting-edge techniques and unexpected ingredient combinations to transform every plate into a culinary experience.\nListed below are some of the dishes that I thought was worth mentioning:\n\nSwiss Chard with White Chocolate Sauce\nThis dish was exceptionally well-prepared. The creamy texture of the Swiss chard was complemented by the delicate white chocolate sauce, which enhanced the overall flavor profile without overwhelming the vegetable’s natural taste. The balance between the savory and sweet elements was executed perfectly, offering a unique and refined experience.\n\nMonkfish Liver\nWhile this dish may not appeal to everyone, it was an interesting exploration of flavors. The robust savory notes of the monkfish liver were well-matched with the candied pomegranate, creating a harmonious contrast. The texture was spread-like, and the slight fishiness was not overpowering. Personally, I found the monkfish liver challenging, but I do appreciate the thoughtful combination of flavor profiles it presents\n\nBelon oyster\nThis dish was innovative and one of the highlights of the evening. Everything was perfectly balanced, and the combination of the oyster with fermented elements and dried mackerel was both creative and delightful, making it a standout favorite.\n\nThe plantain was prepared, with a satisfying kick that added a pleasant depth to the dish. The tuna was also quite impressive, with the onion sauce providing a perfect complement to the fish’s richness.\n\nThe halibut, unfortunately, was not to my taste. The presence of bones and the unusual texture made it feel unbalanced, both in flavor and overall execution.\n\nThe Dungeness crab dish, however, was truly exceptional. The empanada-shaped presentation, resembling a crab, was a brilliant touch. The pairing of Curaçao was particularly noteworthy, enhancing the flavors\n\nThe bread dish was a revelation—impressive enough to stand alone. While some might find it slightly salty, I found it to be a remarkable addition to the meal.\n\nThe rice and pork dish stood out, with the rice being particularly flavorful. However, I would suggest using flat plates instead of bowls, as my bowl kept shifting while I was cutting the dish. The sauce emulsion was excellent, pairing beautifully with the entire dish.\n\nLastly, I appreciated the unique concept of the palate cleanser being a drink. Something different for an experience. And also that the first and last course starts with tea. Great touch!\n\nOverall, it was an incredibly enjoyable experience. Chef Victoria and her team truly excel, showcasing remarkable talent and creativity in every dish. Allen’s service was exceptional, with a level of professionalism and attentiveness worth noting. Luis demonstrated great knowledge in presenting the food, enhancing the overall dining experience. Additionally, Benjamin’s beverage pairing recommendations were spot-on, further complementing the flavors of each course."

EMP at its (pre-Vegan) height bored me, Atomix is obviously excellent but I vastly prefer the food and soul of Atoboy (maybe it’s just the chicken, but still - also I’ve never been to Le Bernardin so no shade to them).\n\nBlanca, however, is now the one in the city I’d slot with my favorites ever - the first in the city since the initial iteration of Ko.\n\nCertainly it has refinement to spare, but almost every dish presents diners with combinations which seem dubious at first - but after the first few conquer your palate you’ll be along for the ride, salivating over what discordant thrills Blamey masters as if born concocting them.\n\nAnd that bread course…I’ll never forget it.\n\nThank you Blanca!!"

The experience is fun if you are curious about food and enjoy trying to guess things out. What’s the ingredient that leaves that crazy flavor? How did the chef got to that dish? Every dish has a story.\n\nWatch the food being prepared by the chef while the team performs a highly coordinated experience serving the guests.\n\nAlso LOVE that the spot is located in a hidden door inside of another place in Bushwick and far away from the Manhattan BS. The contrast of having a fine dining in my trashy neighborhood makes the experience even cooler. 😎 IYKYK\n\nMy partner and I came with our hearts open and we left fulfilled with our soul fed."

From there, we were directed to a dimly lit, extremely grungy bar with red lighting where we had to wait for someone to escort us to the restaurant itself. The vibe felt like it was trying hard to appear effortless, with minimal decor—a fish head on the wall and an open kitchen with a counter in front of it.\n\nThe food was highly experimental (think sorbet with tomatoes), and while creativity is appreciated, it left me feeling underwhelmed. Apart from the tuna strips, nothing truly impressed me. For the steep price point, we were left waiting for that 'wow' moment that never came, and left pretty disappointed.\n\nHad I known how underwhelming the meal would be, I probably would have chosen a different place for such a special occasion."

            "text": "I walked into Roberta’s a little confused. Where is Blanca? Did I miss the entrance? A quick inquiry with the hostess, and I was told to wait by the bar for the maitre d’. After being welcomed in, I was guided through a swarm of Friday night beer drinkers and mom’s with strollers enjoying their pizza to the semi-hidden entrance of Blanca. It was a good vibe at Roberta’s, and I entered Blanca with an upbeat air, excited for the night’s journey. Unfortunately, by the time I left, my mood was dampened. It’s hard to pinpoint, but there was something uncomfortable about the dining experience. Blue Hill, without the Farm Tour. Alinea, without the innovation. Atomix, without the art. The Menu, without the murders.\n\nBlanca is sparse — a high top bar, seated side by side with other Brooklynites celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, surrounding an open kitchen that puts everyone on equal footing to observe the “dance” of the kitchen. The space feels informal, and it’s meant to be fun. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said of the chef. When I snapped some photos of the smoldering flames on the charcoal grill, she came up and scolded me, telling me I’m only allowed to take pictures of my own food. When I tried looking up an ingredient on my phone as she was explaining one of the dishes, she stopped me to ask if I was paying attention. Observing the other diners at the bar, it seemed like they were all basking in the attention of the star chef. She reminds me of Anton Ego from ratatouille BEFORE he tasted the ratatouille.\n\nThe food itself was a mixed bag. Some standouts included the Winter Point Oyster with fermented calamansi, the Crab Empanada, and the Tortilla Al Rescoldo, a fantastic take on a classic Chilean bread stuffed with lamb belly. Unfortunately, these delicious bites were offset by numerous courses that felt half baked — Tomato with rambutan, Easter Egg Radish with grated cheese, and the Summer Fruit sorbet with tomato all felt like they were trying too hard to take advantage of ‘Tomato Season’, while completely disregarding the chef’s strengths.\n\nOn top of that, the ambiguous explanation of foreign ingredients left me feeling confused. There was something that resembled plant stems but tasted like corn.  Some edible cactus-looking flower with leaves that had spikes on them that ended up cutting the inside of my mouth. It’s as if the chef is pressured into using exotic ingredients and shock factor to justify the price. You either accept that you don’t know what you’re eating or you’re figuring out how to spell ‘fri-ka?’ ‘free-cah?’ in Google.\n\nEating here felt like a puzzle.  Most flavours felt overly complicated, yet subpar in terms of memorability. This thumb size spinach roll on a bed of miso dressing and jellied something, basically Goma-ae, a common japanese chilled spinach side dish, presented as if it’s innovative.\n\nAt Blanca, we’re supposed to appreciate the natural tastes of global and local flora and fauna. That said, I just came from Peru and preferred the myriad varietals of street corn and potatoes to anything that Blanca has to offer.\n\nAt $275 and an additional $175 for wine pairing, was it a meal that left me satiated? It was not. There was air of pretentiousness but overall, the experience was just ‘mid’. The bread with lamb belly was fantastic. The oyster and empanada both very good, but put enough fat and butter on anything...\n\nThe lamb entree was quite tough, but with good flavors. All the seasonal vegetable preparations were severely lacking.\n\nWould I go back? No, I’d rather have taken a seat at Roberta’s."

The uni dish, Spanish mackerel, snail pasta dish, bread with chicharon (this was shockingly amazing, shocking because it legit looked like a lump of coal), and the palate cleanser with apple cider granita was bomb. But everything else was not memorable. Also my friend and I both had terrible stomachaches after getting home, so that wasn’t so great either. Probably won’t be going back but glad we tried it."

The last time I visited was late 2019, and it was a magical experience and probably my favorite tasting in all of New York. It was an approachable one that didn’t try to be too experimental and each dish was incredible.\n\nI went back to Blanca in April 2024 and was so disappointed. The concept has changed from Italian to a sloppy fusion of cuisines including Chilean, Pacific island, and Spanish. The pastas were beyond average, lacking the mind blowing flavor they used to have. One tasted like nothing and the second has lavender and bee pollen, so nothing to write home about. The meal lacked any cohesive story and flavor. And as a lover of uni, I can’t believe they managed to make an uni dish that tasted like nothing!\n\nA truly disappointing experience"

With that said, the music was awesome setting a super chill mood, and I think you can requests songs (not 100% on song requests, but it’s basically a playlist they preset and can alter).\n\nChefs were chill and their break down is fun to watch as it enters the end of the meal. 11/10 would recommend for an interesting Brooklyn Michelin star experience, amazing food, good vibes, good music."

There were a couple courses that weren't my favorite, though they were still interesting and worth a bite, but that is to be expected over 17 dishes. (Each course is maybe 2-3 bites.) The progression was logical and had a flow from appetizer-type dishes to main course type dishes to desserts. They were harmonious and well thought out. They were also beautiful to the eye.\n\nThe server and staff were all terrific. I like their lack of pretension (despite having 2 Michelin stars) and they were really interested in our having a great meal. They were friendly and able to answer any questions about a dish. The wine pairings (plus sake, cider and beer) were very well chosen to complement the courses. The attire is casual and guests who were there that night wore everything from jeans and hipster-hat to jacket and tie, but no judgments and everyone was made comfortable and welcome.\n\nIf I had one complaint, and this applies to pretty much all tasting menus, somewhere around course 13 I am completely beyond full and the last few courses (which here included the Wagyu beef) are very uncomfortable. I manage this by having a nibble of these courses and sending the rest over to my husband who has a much bigger capacity than I. But I would like a tasting menu allowing SOME guests to skip a few courses. It's not just Blanca, but pretty much every place I have done tasting menus (and that's a lot of places.) Still, other than the pain to the pocketbook, I would happily eat here regularly."

Since you walk through Roberta's to get to Blanca, my bf and I eyed people's delicious-looking pizza on our way in. We checked in at where we were on the \"pizza meter\" throughout the night. At first we were at 100% pizza given that we were super hungry, but after the fresh dough course, he was down to 30% and we were full by the end of the dinner. They gave us ridiculously delicious smores as a treat to take home, too.\n\nEach course is only a few bites, but they're packed with flavors and beautifully presented. To me, a great tasting menu like this requires two things: 1) inventive use of ingredients that 2) work well together aka taste is on point. Blanca achieved both of these with flying (minimalist) colors. Particular standouts to me were the garbanzo bean soup, apple with macadamia shavings that melted in the mouth, chewy and rich carbonara, nduja sausage ravioli, sunchoke cake with cardamom and chocolate for dessert, and the fresh dough. If you're asking yourself, how good can pizza dough taste? Try some when it's steaming hot. It really tastes that good.\n\nI also much prefer this laid-back more casual environment without the pretension of some three-star Michelin restaurants like Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. It's not a place to be seen, but rather a place to focus on the food and the experience of watching people absorbed in their craft."
