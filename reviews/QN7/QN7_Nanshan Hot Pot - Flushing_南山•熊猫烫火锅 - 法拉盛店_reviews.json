Cute decor.\n\nFood was good—decent amount of meats, seafood and veggies options.  We tried three different broths (Beef Tallow Spicy, Bone Broth & Sour Soup), all relatively good.  Wasn’t too happy with their noodle selection, I prefer thin noodles like vermicelli or glass noodle, which they didn’t have.  They also have a bubble tea menu from the place next door.  Everything here is cost itemized—you are charged by price for everything, even for using their sauce bar!\n\nIf you pay in cash, you get a chance to spin their game for a prize—we won a cute stuffed llama.  Service was great, all the servers were pretty attentive and came by frequently to refill our broths."

Everything is panda-themed, which added a fun and charming touch to the whole dining experience — I loved seeing pandas everywhere!\n\nThe bamboo shoots were a standout for us — fresh, flavorful, and perfect in the hot pot. We tried three soup bases: the classic Mala, rich Tomato, and savory Pork Bone. Each one was incredibly tasty and brought out the best in all the ingredients.\n\nOverall, it was a delightful meal in a unique and enjoyable setting. Can’t wait to come back!"

The interior is really cute and clean, loving the panda theme. The staffs were friendly and attentive, and the overall atmosphere was great and lively. The sauce bar also includes some small dishes and even dessert and fruits. At the end, we got cute panda keychains and an adorable panda plush. It does get pricey, but its all worthwhile."

It’s sufficient and enjoyable though. Wish the portion sizes were larger too. Some meats have a $15-25 a la carte price tag for ~12 slices. Better bang for your buck elsewhere but the quality here was fine if other nearby places are packed.\n\nService was good and attentive. Never had a problem with food coming out fast after ordering.\n\nOnly confusing thing was their rewards program. There are discount prices if you join the rewards, at least based on the ordering tablet, but the setup is confusing and the staff didn’t socialize it so we were didn’t end up redeeming."

Tomato broth is def the best, beef tallow broth is a let down (just spicy and not really umami).  They have many ingredients I haven’t seen at other places before, super cute young bamboo shoot presentation. Tender beef with egg yolk was yummy, but would prob save that for last to eat as it clouds the broth with a lot of egg bits. Sauce bar was good and free single serve ice cream cups in the end. Meal is cheaper if you guys voucher credits online. But they have a weird system where the amount of credit you have left has to be larger than the bill total to make you forever topping up or wasting it."

I tried the sour soup (tastes like their fruit soup base with sour and spicy notes) and love that too!
