I went into order two eggs not on a roll. They wanted to charge me five dollars but yesterday when I ordered those two eggs in a roll, they charged me 3.50. Does that make sense? The person explaining it to me, couldn’t even give me a reason as to why two eggs would cost more by themselves than on a roll. Just “this is how the pricing is” I work right around the corner me and all my coworkers would usually get from there, but I won’t be going back :(."
