Serve me with tortilla chips and home made salsa and verde sauce. quite spicy. ordered Tacos de Birria and it was amazing. They are quite a big portion and sort of messy but I would still eat there than have it take out. but I still choose to eat with my hands any day.\n\nTamarind juice was so good (and needed to calm my palette)\nI will 100 % visit again and try more food.\nThe 2 men who served me was kind and lovely who tries to always attend to my needs (more tissues, wifi, etc)"

You also get a cup of birria consome on the side to dip into.  It was pretty good though I think I'd like it even better if the tortillas were full hard shell crunchy."

Every bite is a mouthful of spice, meat, filling, cilantro, salsa verde y rojo (I made these up .. sorry but they’re salsas to die for) .. with a squirt of the lime, chunks of cheese balances the whole power of taste. The tacos were a bit soggy as I didn’t eat it on site but brought it home, but as it got limpier, messier, I’m glad I’m home to devour such flavourful tacos without embarrassing myself in public. The consommé is liquid gold I can slurp this any time of the day. Spicy hot but not too chilly to numb my palette it is ‘noisily slurping off the cup’ good. Every spice got its own time in the taco sun. Amazing. Will be back! (Where’s my beer)"
