Their hummus and tahini are silky smooth and made fresh daily. Friendly staff, fast service, and very reasonable prices make this a go-to spot for anyone craving real, delicious Middle Eastern food.

Upon arrival you would see that it wasn’t the most up-kept place but don’t let the mom and pop feeling fool you. The falafel pita was sooooo light refreshing flavorful, like I was at lost for words with each bite. I plan on taking a trip VERY SOON… NY TIMES was spot on when they said they are the best in the city."

They were light, small, soft on the inside with just the right crisp on the outside. I never knew falafel could be like this!!\n\nGot a sabich pita and a falafel pita to try both, and separate falafel balls and everything was wonderful. Excellent prices too!!!\n\nThe sabich comes with egg. And either pita dish comes with whatever of 11 different things you'd want to load into them - hummus, garlic, pickles, tahini, two different types of cabbage, sourkraut, Israeli salad...\n\nThere is an outdoor dining area but it's hot and doesn't look like much. The inside is crammed and chaotic."
