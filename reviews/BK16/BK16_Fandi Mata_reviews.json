            "text": "Came to Fandi Mats for an 8it app Family Meal event so my experience is strictly from that event’s perspective. I was SO impressed by the space, the attentive staff and the energy of the space. Just as much credit goes to Steve and Mac the founders of the 8it app as it does to the restaurant for creating an amazing experience for those who work in the dining industry. They really took care of us last night.\n\nUpon arrival, I was taken aback by the beauty of the space. It was all setup for the Dia de Los Muertos themed event, with candles and dancers in character floating around the space.\n\nThe event had a tequila tasting from Dobel, an Aperol bar, and the best margaritas. The winner of Top Chef Mexico, Carmen Miranda a generational tamalera who still prepares her handmade  tamales with extreme care in a labor of love one week process. This was a pop up that needs to be permanent. The staff made sure there wasn’t a single empty glass or plate on any table as we feasted the night away to a female DJ/percussionist duo. Definitely have to try it the place out on a non event night to get a true taste of it. Thanks team for taking care of the industry last night!"

The place is atmospheric and beautiful, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the drinks were delicious. The food was outstanding, making the experience even more enjoyable. The floor manager kindly substituted my fries for a salad with my steak, even though substitutions aren’t usually offered. He even stopped by to open a bottle of champagne for us — such a thoughtful touch. Everything was so mindful and welcoming. I’ll definitely be coming back!"

I started with oysters, which were fresh and delicious. My steak came overcooked, but they quickly replaced it with perfectly cooked duck breast. Solid food, great service, and a nice atmosphere overall. Ideal spot for a date night or a relaxed dinner with a friend."

I really liked the interior, lighting, mood, and overall ambiance—it definitely had a beautiful spirit.\n\nI ordered the octopus salad as an appetizer, lamb chops as my main, and chocolate and pistachio ice cream for dessert.\n\nThe octopus salad was amazing—everything was fresh, and the salad was chopped really nicely, which made me enjoy the texture and balance even more. The octopus itself tasted great in the mix.\n\nThe lamb chops, however, were not traditionally cut. I asked for them medium-well, but they didn’t have the flavor I was hoping for. I finished the dish, but I wouldn’t order it again. That said, the zucchini relish that came on the plate was fantastic.\n\nThe ice cream was also good—I liked it.\n\nOne thing I have to mention is that it really bothers me to pay $6 for a flat fountain Diet Coke. Why not serve a canned soda instead? Wouldn’t you want to offer the best drink possible to your customers, whether it’s alcoholic or non-alcoholic? A bad drink lowers the overall dining experience.\n\nLastly, I think there’s some room for improvement in the service, particularly in terms of communication.\n\nThat said, I would consider going back there in the future."

I found the happy hour options to be very limited considering how extensive their drinks menu is (it's longer than the food menu). It also took some time for the bartender to acknowledge me, get me a menu, and take my drink order. He didn't really speak to me, didnt offer a menu when I sat down, and I wasnt even sure he heard my order because he didnt say anythjng before walking away. The bar wasn't busy at the time so I wasn't sure what was happening. When we were ready for our table, he did say he would transfer our drinks and food to our table so we didnt have to check out at the bar so that was very helpful. The sparkling wine and hummus were very good.\n\nWe did have to move our initial table because we were closer to the kitchen and for some reason, we would get hit with a very strong, not so great smell. The hostess was very pleasant and moved us up to the front and we were grateful, not only due to the issue with the previous table but also because the staff in this section were way more attentive and friendly than the ones in the previous section. It really improved the experience. As the night went on, the restaurant did fill up and they had a dj playing music. The vibes were great, the space looked as wonderful at night as it does during the day.\n\nThe food and drinks were amazing. There wasn't a single thing I was disappointed with. My friend said that the smoked beets were just ok. I didn't try them but I did try the cabbage on that plate and that was good; she agreed. The lamb chops were absolutely delicious. The flavors, the presentation, the portion....all excellent. My French fries were crisp and delicious. The Brussel sprouts were good as well, wouldn't be my first choice for a side next time but still good.\n\nI was so happy to see that they had mocktail options since I was driving. I got the Eye of the Tiger. This was my favorite thing of the night (sorry lamb chops). It was so refreshing and flavorful; as complex and well thought out any alcoholic cocktail. I really appreciated that. I could have drank 10 of them. And speaking of drinks...this is small and weird but I really liked it...they offered us sparkling or still water and I opted for sparkling....not sure why but I've never drank so much water in a restaurant before. It was sooo refreshing for some reason.\n\nBathroom was clean and adequate. With the style of the doors, it is hard to tell which ones are occupied.\n\nThe dessert options were great. I liked both the pudding and the Tart.\n\nGratuity was automatically included in the check.\n\nWould like to come back to try their brunch menu."

If you are thinking about ordering  keep in mind you can only order them medium rare. My date thought the steak was delicious and well seasoned, however it was just slightly more cooked than she asked for.

One of the best cheeseburgers I have enjoyed in a really long time.  Reasonable prices and the drinks were fun.  Great place to celebrate my wife's birthday."

From start to finish, the team went above and beyond to make the day absolutely perfect.\n\nThe space itself is stunning—warm, vibrant, and unique, with such a beautiful atmosphere for both the ceremony and the reception. We held everything here—ceremony, light apps, dinner, and dancing—and every single part was seamless.\n\nThe food was exceptional. From the appetizers to the main dinner, every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavor. Our guests are still raving about how delicious everything was! The drinks were just as impressive—creative, balanced, and served with style.\n\nWhat truly set the night apart, though, was the staff. They were attentive, professional, and so genuinely kind. Every detail was handled with care, and they made us feel so taken care of throughout the evening. Planning a wedding can be stressful, but Fandi Mata’s team made the entire process feel effortless.\n\nWe are so grateful to Fandi Mata for creating the most magical setting for such a special day. If you’re looking for an unforgettable event space with incredible food, drinks, and service, look no further—you’ve found it here."
