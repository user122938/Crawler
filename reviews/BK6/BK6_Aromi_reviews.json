The Rigatoni Vodka was seriously the best I’ve ever had and one of the best dishes I’ve ever had in all of Las Vegas. The services was also 10/10. When we sat down with our 2 year old, the waiter offered to start some butter noodles immediately. Our son ate the whole plate and was in a noodle-coma in no time at all, so mom and dad got to enjoy the rest of the meal in peace! I have no notes for this place! Thank you for an amazing night out with family."

Try MBP - mortadella, burrata, pistachio- thank me later - your life will never be the same.\n- crispy calamari- not greesy, perfectly crunchy and the black ink mayo brings it to another level.\n- branzino with clams and mussles  - wow! Fish was flacky and moist - phenomenal!\n- tiramisu - so rich and satisfying.\nAnd the atmosphere of this restaurant is amazing: it is busy, lively, happy, and makes you feel like you are somewhere in Italy: the waiters are very knowledgeable and professional. Our waiter gave us great recommendations for food and wine. The hostess is accommodating and welcoming.\nI cannot wait to be back!

We where lucky to meet the owners: Sara and Andrea lovely, people, friendly. We had to try the tiramisu and it was absolutely delicious.

The customers went in and out, the spacing was a bit rushed, and we felt as if we could not really relax and enjoy this evening. The servers were coming to the table, making sure everything is great. But overall, we felt a bit rushed and had to order extra food just to feel that we deserve to stay in this place a little longer. Maybe it’s just us, but it felt a little bit uncomfortable on the server was ready to hand us our receipt before we even asked for a second round of drinks. I feel a little bit ashamed of how this cozy feeling of a family owned restaurant quickly changed to something like a food court where everybody wants you gone. Still I can recommend this place wholeheartedly for couples who just want to go on a quick date."

So this place I found by pure strike of luck,  as Brazilian restaurant where I had reservation has been closed already,  we decided to give it a try to its next door neighbor. So, this is an Italian place where everyone from the owner to the waiter speaks Italian... Should I say more?\nThey specialize in pizza as they have a real fire oven, and your pizza will be prepared as you order. They have a variety of good pastas, but you definitely have to try their ribeye steak!!! This place gets on top of the list of my favorite steak places! The finger potatoes that go and the side are out of this world, too.\nThe stuff and the owner are very friendly and helpful to make sure that you will be satisfied to the fullest. Really great place!

The ambiance was warm and inviting, with families of all sizes gathered around, enjoying their meals together—a rare, heartwarming sight in Manhattan’s dining scene, where family-friendly vibes are less common.\n\nMy son had the kids’ pasta, and it was exceptional. Unlike many places that simply add butter and grated cheese, this dish was crafted with care. The chef emulsified the butter with pasta water, creating that perfect \"cremosa\" texture. It was beautifully simple, and the taste was outstanding. I enjoyed it so much that I plan to order it for myself next time!\n\nI ordered the linguine al nero al frutti di mare, which was flavorful, and we also shared the Pizza Margherita. The dough, with its perfect texture and craftsmanship, was a standout. While the sauce and cheese were light in flavor. Next time, I might go for a savory topping. A pro tip: I used the crust of the pizza to soak up the sauce from the linguine—a move I’ll definitely repeat.\n\nWe also enjoyed a delightful Frappato from the wine list, which I highly recommend. The service was lovely, and our waitress, Rachel (if I’m remembering her name correctly), took great care of us. We’ll be back soon for more!"

And a Bentley is 'a car.'\nThis is a sleek, sophisticated, well-tuned restaurant that offers gorgeously-done food, well-presented and supported.\nWe made reservations for 3 at about 7 pm on a Sunday. Wanted to sit outside; back porch full; so sat in front (they just opened this option.) (Would like to have had backs on chairs, not benches.) Excellent gin and mescal Negronis to open. Then appetizers of Pungiente walnut/spring greens salad (to split) and ... a *spectacular* kalamari with black squid mayo. As far as I'm concerned the dinner could have ended right there. I've never had that combination, and the owner tells me he and his partners worked that out themselves. Spit three ways it was copious. Splendid.\nWe had a branzino al cartoccio, black linguini with mussels, and (evening special) a pappardelle Bolognese. A delightful Montepulciano that punched above its weight.\nIt's hard to say what was the most enjoyable. I think the linguini with squid ink and mussels was the most creative dinner; the bolognese was the most 'user-friendly'.  The service was excellent; a young Sardinian is doing excellent work; the owner and wait staff were delightful but not intrusive.\nAn absolutely delightful dinner.\nI can't wait to come back.\nVery highly recommended."

There were few people when we first sat down and had to chance to meet Alessandro who was incredibly nice and helped us pick a few items on the menu. We had the focaccia, Margherita pizza, and eggplant app. They were all absolutely incredible. Their bread/olive oil is phenomenal, and the red sauce is the best I’ve been able to find in nyc. Couldn’t recommend it enough."

The food was really tasty we met one of the owners, Andrea. He was super friendly and accommodating. We came on New Year's Day since so many other restaurants were closed for the day, and gave it a shot as we had never been. It instantly became one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Cobble Hill neighborhood. Definitely check out the meatball appetizer and the carbonara. Highly recommended. 🙂"
