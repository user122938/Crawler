The food and beverages were amazing, the preparation emaculate, the smiles genuine and the foot traffic - overstood. This place is not luxurious, but that's not of concern. We found it to be a comfy familial atmosphere, with a restroom, fresh cooked meals, and good products - especially the iced Vietnamese coffee. Hands down the best I've ever tasted. We'll be back!"

The Banh mis are thr best ive had and the pork, rice and salas is great as well.\n\nMy only wish is that they had some more vegeterian options since apart from the egg banh mi, there is nothing else. The other thing would be accepting card payments. But overall great food, service and prices."

Their pandan cake used to be one of my favorites too.\n\nBut lately, both the food quality and service have become inconsistent.\n\n1️⃣ I once drove 30 minutes just to get the last pandan cake, but it turned out dense, sunken, and hard — clearly a failed batch.\n2️⃣ The next visit, every single cake on the shelf had sunk in the middle. I couldn’t understand why they’d still sell those.\n3️⃣ Another time, I called around 1 PM to check availability. The owner vaguely said there were two left and could hold them, then mentioned the next batch wouldn’t be ready until 5 PM. When I tried to confirm, she hung up on me.\n\nI really regret not taking photos — they would’ve shown exactly what I mean."

            "text": "The aunties and the food here deserve your tips if you can afford it!\n\nHaving lived in the neighborhood for a few years, I've really come to appreciate how, thanks to their commitment to keeping prices low, Ba Xuyen is a cornerstone for so many different parts of the community, from old Southern Chinese aunties and uncles catching up to Hispanic workers and English-only newcomers in the neighborhood. The kindness of the workers, the low prices, and the stellar food welcomes everyone. There's two aunties working there in particular who just radiate warmth.\n\nAs food goes, plenty has been said about the Banh Mi. But my favorite item is easily the Chicken Rice lunch box. I can't include a photo because I already finished mine. For $8 you get 2-3 meal portion of juicy chicken and fresh veggies with a lovely chili sauce on the side. The best part is the rice: it's lightly marinated in the oils from the chicken in a way that reminds me of Hainanese chicken rice. Except this is half the usual price of Hainanese chicken rice, and double the usual portion.\n\nAlso, delicious, delicious 4$ Vietnamese iced coffee. Add $1 tip, since they make it better than your local barista makes their $8 half-size version."

Ever since I moved into the neighborhood ten years ago, their menu has remained completely unchanged—a testament to how well-loved it is. They offer eight classic baguette sandwiches, and the pickled carrots inside are marinated in white vinegar, giving them a refreshingly tangy flavor that’s especially perfect for summer.\n\nOne important thing to note: they only accept cash, so make sure to bring some with you if you’re planning to visit.\n\nIn the summer, there are also hidden menu items available at the front counter, like spring rolls filled with vermicelli noodles and shrimp. These items aren’t listed on the main menu, but you can just grab them and pay at the counter.\n\nAnd if you’re lucky, you might spot an “outside” menu on display—featuring quick hot meals like fried rice, fried noodles, spring rolls, and shrimp-based dishes. It’s super casual, fast, and surprisingly flavorful.\n\nIf you’re looking to explore the local food scene, this is one spot you absolutely can’t miss—a true neighborhood classic."

I order the grilled pork banh mi for 8 dollars which is very reasonable considering the size and flavors. The bread (assuming baguette) is nice and crispy exterior with a chewy interior. But it starts to cut the side of your mouth and makes it dry. The fillings flavors were very harmonized and well balanced but to have all of them together you gotta take a big bite because the meat is all the way inside while cilantro is in the outer layer. The flavors are very rich and have that sweet and sour taste in the sauce for the meat. Meat is also tender and is given in a fair amount. The vegetables are very fresh and the pepper gives it that extra spice which brings everything together. I believe the vegetables like cucumber may be pickled because the overall flavors are complex and deep. Closing statement: Bringing your own drink can help quench the dryness that the bread will give you."

Every banh mi has a base of cucumber, cilantro, pickled carrots and green pepper. My go-to banh mi order is the bestselling combination #1. It has ham, pork, pork teriyaki & BBQ with paté and butter. It is so filling that I can get two meals out of it.\n\n＊Jackfruit Shake\nI can’t leave this place without getting their milkshake. They blend actual fruits into the shakes, giving it a natural and sweet flavor. They have tropical fruit flavors like lychee, taro, papaya and durian. I heard good things about their avocado shake, but I always stick to my favorite jackfruit shake."

I have had many delicious Banh Mi with good, fresh ingredients that have been ruined by chewy bread, stale bread, or overly “American” sub bread. This bread has an excellent outer crispiness with a soft warm interior. The balance of meat to vegetables to sauce is perfect.

It is very much worth the trip to Sunset Park, and is a must have if you’re in the neighborhood. The baguettes that they use for the sandwiches are just heavenly fresh and crispy - so good that they retain their freshness for the next 1-2 days (so I’ll buy a few sandwiches to eat as my lunch the next day). The price can’t be beat — most sandwiches run from $6-7 each, and they are generous with portions and use fresh ingredients. I highly recommend #1 for the classic combination banh mi sandwich, and my wife loves #9 for the grilled chicken banh mi. The shop is very unassuming and the ladies preparing sandwiches behind the window are brisk but friendly, and they speak English. Tip them well and keep supporting this local gem. Businesses like these are what make NYC the greatest city to live in."

The number one comes with different cuts of vietnamese hams, some grilled pork, cucumber, parsley, and pickled carrots&turnip. The number eight was the same but without the ham cuts. The \"spicy\" in my sandwich, or the jalapeno pepper slices, were somewhat spicy. (Guess it depends on ur luck in terms of getting spicy pepper versus non spicy ones lol)\nOther than that they have around 6 tables for seating and other types of snacks available for sale too, like durian mung bean cake... etc. Very casual place to grab a quick meal.\nOverall, it was a good experience 0w0.
