The medium size regular smoothie will run you $5 which is 24oz and you can choose to get a large for a dollar more or a small for a dollar less.

First, I loved their food and prices and portions, which is why this isn't a 1 star review; HOWEVER, I was there yesterday and I saw a ROACH literally come out crawl across the area above the counter and fall into the bananas. I was skeeved to the fullest. Because I'm a decent human and understand that these things happen, instead of making a big deal, I quietly told the guy who is like the manager or owner there what I had just seen and he was like, \"I'm sorry about that we just sprayed yesterday.\" At this point I wanted to cancel the food because obviously any desire for dinner had disappeared, but I saw they were already making it so I was like okay whatever let it not go to waste. Then, the part that everybody was shocked at ... he actually charged me for the food. I was a bit surprised myself, but I didn't want the confrontation after a long day so I paid and left. My dog had some salmon for dinner. Anyway, I was going to just let it go and wasn't going to write anything and but the consensus is that if you have roaches and a customer sees one the least you do is not charge them and pray to Gd that they don't tell anybody."
