Ask your guests what they want and if you are just given bottled water it should be free. Felt a bit sleazy.\n\n2. When we put two cards down to split the bill he refused. Demanded 1 card.\n\n3. When we signed and paid. When he collected the bill he opened it in front of us to see the tip.\n\nJust not a New York standard at all or should I say not a standard we should let slide in this great city of food.\n\nBut as mentioned food was great.\n\nWe were the only 2 people in the restaurant. Quite a few uber eats type pickups while we were there."

Whether it’s a quiet weekday meal or a weekend treat, Dhania never disappoints.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart, though, is the people. Mr. Chowdhury, the manager, is one of the kindest and most helpful people I’ve met in the restaurant world. He genuinely cares about his customers and always goes the extra mile to make sure everything is perfect.\n\nThe staff are incredibly warm and proactive – they check in to see if you need anything, always offer water with a smile, and treat you like family. It's those little touches that make all the difference."

Chatney awesome.\nChicken Tikka was great!\nBiriyani & butter chicken was Excellent!\nNaan was fine & soft! Not hard or burned as some other places.\n\nSince I ordered catering for my congregation from many restaurants in Houston, I became an expert in S.

They charged $3 plus tax for a single roti, which is usually just $1 and naan price is 2$ at any normal Indian/Pakistani restaurant in brooklyn. And for that price, i received a burnt, dry, and badly cooked roti.honestly the worst I’ve ever had. When i pointed out the issue, the staff were dismissive and showed zero interest in making it right.The way they treated me was unacceptable. For overpriced, low quality food and disrespectful service, this place is a hard no. Save your time, money, and go somewhere else."

I must say that I initially thought the portions seemed “small,” but I was proved wrong. Each one of those bowls was packed with the corresponding sources of protein.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Rasmalai, which was delicious and “fun,” and the Gulab Jamun (it looks like cocktail sausages), which you would love if you like desserts on the sweeter side.\n\nWe were a group of 6 (we had a reservation) and visited on a Thursday night. The restaurant was mainly quiet (except for us 😄), so it felt like a private experience.\n\nTwo things I should also mention: they will recommend ordering bottled water as they “don’t really trust” the tap water in there, and the menus have corrections done with markers, which sometimes were hard to read or understand."
