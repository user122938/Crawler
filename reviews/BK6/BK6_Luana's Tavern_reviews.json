With that being sent, each & every time  I hope I get the waitress named Andrea. Waitressing at its finest. She was attentive, FRIENDLY and as a table of 5, she read everything on that menu as if she was making it for us herself! She also knew which drinks we would like just by us telling her very little about our taste! So professional and QUICK ON HER FEET! We will definitely be coming back and telling everyone we know, not only for the food but for her! We had all ordered the steak, three well done (DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME MIGHT I ADD) which is difficult in many restaurant. Two medium rare and not one complaint from anyone at our table. I’m also going to tell my friends at their magazine to come check this out! Also the outside was very nice and neat! Would love to sit back there again!"

The owners are so gracious and are clearly actively involved in the day to day of the restaurant. Many of the clientele seemed to know one another or spot friends while there. It truly felt like a local, neighborhood spot that any neighborhood in any city in the country would be lucky to have. Food and cocktails were top notch. This will be a must on all my future trips to the area. Thank you to Enrique and your team for a fantastic and memorable evening!"

I don’t know if they overbooked or what, but we were shoved at a small table right next to the kids little play area - which was awful. Kids run around without any supervision, throwing toys and climbing walls, it’s literally anarchy (and I have a kid!). It took 25 minutes to get our drinks (and another ten after that to get a club soda), 45 minutes to get our food, and they completely forgot one meal. Our server came back once an hour if we were lucky. There were people hovering by our table standing and drinking, and we had to ask the staff twice to please ask them to move so we could eat without their butts in our faces. The whole experience was bizarre, the food was mediocre at best (and not worth the price or the wait). I will not be back, and I will be sure to tell others of our experience, because YIKES, guys."

She was easy to work with, relaxed and very accommodating. Without hesitation, she worked with me to ensure that she stayed within my budget. All the food was great and plenitful; from the passed hors D'oeuvres, to the entree platters, to the giant soft baked chocolate chip cookies for dessert. At the start of the event, Alana and Enrique (the owners), came out to see if there was anything we needed to make sure the party met our expectations. They even insisted on providing wine for my husband and I to drink that pleased our palates. Our friends and family loved the vibe at Luana's and raved about the food and drinks. It set the tone for what was a memorable wedding weekend!"

One of the standout features is the large amount of outdoor seating—it’s perfect for enjoying a meal on a nice day without feeling cramped. The service was impressively fast and genuinely friendly, which added a welcoming touch to the experience.\n\nAs for the food, it was just okay. While everything was cooked well and presented nicely, most of the dishes seriously lacked flavor, which was a bit of a letdown. That said, the overall atmosphere and service made the visit enjoyable enough that I’d still consider coming back—hopefully the kitchen tightens up the seasoning next time."

My family lives 2 subway stops away from this place and I've been there 3 times in the last month.\n\nFirst of all, the food is AMAZING. This place is so unassuming because it't just a pub, however, every dish we have ordered is super on point. For example, the pork chop was thick and the sauce was creamy, tasty with a hint of acidity from the roasted apples. They do classics but do it very, very well. Even the pave potatoes that goes on the side of the steak are amazing and very technique driven. We were very impressed.\n\nSecond of all, the service is really on point. The owner, Enrique, is a true family man and this place is very kid-friendly as well.\n\nLastly, I really like the wine list that they have as well. Very well put together and you know they put in good work for it.\n\nAll and all, a must try for anyone in Brooklyn looking for a great meal in a casual setting."

When I discovered that they have ricotta pancakes, I had to go for brunch. I chose the perfect Saturday to go. It was a beautiful day with beautiful weather. When I first laid eyes on the restaurant, I loved how it had plenty of outdoor seating. It was not busy when I entered and I was able to sit wherever I wanted. My waitress Andrea provided great service. She was very nice! I ordered a cup of coffee and started off with Franks in a blanket. They were yummy. They came with two sauces to dip them in. Then I got the Ricotta Pancakes. They were very delicious. Light and fluffy! I I ordered a side order of scrambled eggs which were yummy as well. I almost wanted to order the PB&J French Toast because it sounded so good. Next time! My waitress Andrea complimented me on my order. She said she also would have picked out the exact items like I did for her meal. I was pleasantly surprised on how many families started to come into the restaurant after me. That’s when I realized how family-friendly this restaurant is. I even saw a lot of people bring in their dogs. That was very nice. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and I would definitely come back again because there were so many things I still want to try out. I saw on instagram that they serve a great steak. So I gladly recommend this restaurant to everyone."

I was not super attentive to what was going on inside, but it also did not appear to be packed. We took advantage of the beautiful weather and the outdoor vibes were fantastic! My only small issue was they seated another party of two immediately near us when there were plenty of open tables available.\n\nI got the smash burger ($23) and my friend got the wild mushroom pappardelle ($21). We split a brownie sundae, but I didn't inquire about the price. My friend enjoyed the pappardelle and had no complaints. I thought the fries were done better than the burger but the dish itself is nothing special, especially for a $23 price point. The patties on the smash burger are so thin they have to cook it medium, and nothing about the sauce or flavor on the meat was outstanding. The brownie in the sundae was also on the dry side, slightly compensated for by the ice cream, but also unimpressive.\n\nService was phenomenal, and I wish I caught the server's name so I could recommend her! She did very frequent check backs but in a friendly, not pushy, manner. Overall, I would recommend Luana's if you're looking for a more upscale dining spot with decent food and excellent vibes."

Sorry, no buckets of bottled Bud Light. Instead, on a  July Friday evening in 2024, the oysters were savory and enhanced with house sauces; the Tavern Burger was enough for two post graduates. The venue has tin ceilings, an inviting old bar and a big outdoor cafe filled with diners drawn by a very capable band. Service was welcoming."

Even the chef came out and I had to thank him on a meal well prepared. The food was just pure perfection. The taste, the temperature, the texture. I ordered the stake, medium rare, it tasted amazing and practically melted in my mouth, very well marinated. The burger had flavor which is rare to find these days. My friends each ordered something and every single one of them said the same thing, it was great. The drinks were so good that we just kept ordering more. Glad to know their bartender knows what they’re doing. If the food stays this good and the customer service stays this good as well, they will be seeing a lot more of me. Highly recommended to all."

Our event was originally booked with the previous restaurant at this location, but Alana and the team were very accommodating to our large group of 21, were flexible with our dietary restrictions, and were helpful in figuring out the right arrangements for our event when ownership changed over. All of the guests loved the location and the outdoor patio. We were thankful for the awning as it was a hot summer day and it was nice to have the shade. Our event menu included mimosas and Bellinis with fresh juices (you could taste the difference!) the BLT salad, mushroom toast, pancakes, avocado toast and sliders (and donuts for dessert from Brandon’s Donuts located next door). I thinks the two toasts and pancakes were the fan favorites, but everything was delicious. An extra shout out to the servers who were efficient and attentive!"

The food was quite good.\n\nWe need more neighborhood  restaurants with a nice variety of dishes on the menu at a reasonable price. Luana's fits the bill.\n\nWe had the duck wings, mushroom toasts, the corn ribs, the steamed clams, the asparagus with quinoa,  and  the tuna nicoise salad. For the most part, the food was very well executed.\n\nDuck wings were very tasty and I loved the presentation. There was a very interesting sauce under the duck wings which I was told was hoisin and mayonnaise but didn't really taste like that combo.\n\nThere was a nice assortment of mushrooms on the mushroom toast.\n\nCorn ribs were fun and tasty.\n\nThe clams were perfectly cooked but the sauce was a bit bland. I couldn't taste much garlic in it even though I could see it.\n\nThey went a little hard with the preserved lemon in the quinoa on the asparagus. The quinoa was kind of dull-looking and only had the preserved lemon in it. I would have like there'd be some fresh herbs and or scallions or chives in it to break up the beige and add a little more flavor, contrast, and texture\n\nI love how beautifully cooked tuna was in the nicoise salad but the fish itself could have used some more dressing.\n\nThe only thing we didn't care for was the Cherry Pie. The crust was fine but the filling was really thick and gluggy without any of the acidicity you'd expect in a fruit pie.\n\nThe antique bar is gorgeous.\nThis place was very loud inside. We were sitting right under the speaker. There was live music outside the night we were there.\n\nOur server was charming and gracious, if not the most efficient but he got it together in the end.\n\nWe would definitely go back."

I have been stopping in quite a bit because of how consistently good it is; it hits all the right notes for a casual dinner and drinks, but also is stand out to the point where I make an effort to bring my out of town friends through.\n\nThe food is the stand out: in my opinion, it far outshines the majority of the places in the neighborhood, especially at the price. Everything is crafted with care, and several dishes are stand out: the smash burger, the pork chop, even the fries: they’re done right. You can tell that the chef knows their stuff.\n\nAnd then there is the service. The staff have taken time to get to know me, and they clearly strive to make it an atmosphere that is family first.

They ask about my pets, they see me in the neighborhood and say hi, they know me and my tastes and are able to recommend stuff for me to order.\n\nI’m so glad Luana’s opened.

At dinner I like their burger, their salmon (it’s that good!), and the steak. My kids love the franks in a blanket and I think my wife could live on just the French onion soup.\n\nNote the new owner was a huge upgrade here."
