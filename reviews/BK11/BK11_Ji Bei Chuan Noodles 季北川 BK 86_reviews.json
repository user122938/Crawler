Their set meals as they advertised on the menu was pretty interesting. Basically, one of the sets comes with a noodle soup of your choice, an appetizer, and a drink. There are also other sets that are different.\n\nI would definitely come back again if I was to."

You can load up a prepaid card for bonus credits. We did $300 and got $50 bonus. There’s also 2 different special menu options that offer a bowl of noodles, small appetizer, and a drink for $17.95 option. All in all, they try really hard to promote their business and find value for their customers which is a major plus. I ordered the beef tomato soup base, which came out piping hot! So be careful to not burn your tongue/ mouth. The place itself feels super well organized and clean, albeit not that big, so expect a long wait during dinner rush hours. Friendly staff is also a plus here!"

I ordered the dumplings in spicy oil and crispy coconut lava balls as appetizers.  The seafood tom yum soup with rice noodles had a nice variety of seafood.  The silken tofu with fish slices was a smooth and light soup with rice noodles.  The food was well-prepared and packaged well in an insulated reusable bag.  Friendly and helpful staff."

Having previously held a favorable impression of this establishment, I recommended it to a friend on this occasion. However, when we started eating, we found only three to four small pieces of beef briskets in each order. Also, the quality of the brisket was concerning. A notable portion exhibited an unpleasant odor, im sure its been in the freezer for a very long time, the restaurant must have thought that customer wouldn't notice mixing fresh and old ingredients together, and the texture was markedly rubbery. Nothing like before. Beside that, my friend also discovered a piece of plastic within their noodle dish. This is usually what franchises do: they make the dishs more generous and better when starting, then drop the quality and ingredients to cut cost.\nIt's been my favorite place for so long, and im not going back ever again."

From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with a warm, inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. The menu is packed with a wide variety of rice noodle dishes, each bursting with bold and delicious flavors.\n\nWhat truly stands out is the freshness of the noodles — perfectly chewy, with just the right texture. I tried their signature dish, and it was hands down one of the best rice noodle dishes I've ever had. The broth was rich and flavorful, with just the right balance of spices, and the toppings were fresh and generous.\n\nThe service was impeccable — friendly, attentive, and quick, which really enhanced the overall experience. Whether you're looking for a comforting bowl of noodles on a cold day or craving something flavorful and satisfying, Jibeichuan has got you covered.\n\nHighly recommend it for anyone in the mood for authentic, mouthwatering rice noodles. Can’t wait to return!"
