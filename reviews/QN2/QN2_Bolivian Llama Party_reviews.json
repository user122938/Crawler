I happen to be from Bolivia and I must say that these salteñas did not live up to my expectations for not only the price that I paid for them ($81 for a dozen), but also the fact that the taste and texture were completely off. I felt as though the ingredients were inconsistent and muddy, especially the chicken, which I have never in my life seen cut into square cubes in a salteña. The chicken itself was largely absent from the flavor, giving me the impression that it was either partially thawed or barely present in the first place. The masa was lacking crunch. I hope this was a fluke, but as someone who misses salteñas and is often homesick, I was very disappointed. (P.S I think it was too much parsley, and I think there were carrots and peas in it too)"

Then the food, OMG, best truffle fries you can try in NY, Salteñas are always a good to go (chicken is my favorite!!), all the bowls are delicious, their chicken sandwiches, veggie choices, everything is amazing there, I am not even vegetarian but I love their jackfruit sandwiches! One of the best places in Sunnyside for sure, I highly recommend trying BLP, they never disappoint! ☺️"

Now that they have outdoor seating again, they've cultivated an enjoyable atmosphere to dine in.\n\nThe salteñas are truly mind-blowing. The dough is really tasty and also skillfully made to hold the soup filling. The fried chicken sandwich is one of the tastiest I've had in my life. I love their juices and ice creams as well.\n\nI only wish I knew about this restaurant in time to snag one of the t-shirts they were selling"

So it was really good,  but I wished I had only gotten one.\n\nAsk the dishes being brought it around new looked amazing. So I'm excited to go back and try something new!"

Little things like that make a difference. Will definitely be back!"

He made us feel welcome and right at home. The salteñas are so scrumptious and filled with flavor.  I love how juicy and stewy they are.  French fries are perfectly crispy. The Bros’ter chicken strips are so tender juicy.  The mac and cheese is super tasty. We loved everything!  And the prices are very reasonable. We’ll be back again soon."

The chicken sandwich is one of the best in the city, their cilantro mayo is a hidden gem. They need to sell that sauce in jars, unreal. The staff here are so friendly and sweet"

            "text": "Hola a todo la comunica de Google Map, chicos!\nBueno, esta vez les quiero hacer mi reseña de un este establecimiento de comida tipica Boliviana, esta en Sunnyside, Queens, NYC. Quiero aclarar que no es un Restaurante para comer adentro, ya que cuando llegas a este lugar solamente te atienden por ventanilla, pedis lo que hay en la Carta y esperas que te llamen por tu nombre.\nQuiero aclarar tambien que tengo algo de conocimientos de comida tipica Boliviana, por eso hago mi reseña con conocimiento de esta rica comida Boliviana. Por lo que pude ver por la ventana, es un establecimiento familiar completamente, por eso cuando vayan para allá, veran que las comidas son simples y muy ricas.\nPor ser primera vez, yo pedi Empanadas Salteñas Bolivianas de Pollo y Sopa de Mani, todo para llevar. El tiempo de espera para llevar la comida fue dentro de todo lo normal, una demora entre 5 a 9 minutos, eso es bueno. La chica que me atendio fue muy amable y siempre brindando una atencion muy buena.\nUna vez que llegue a mi casa, comimos las Empanadas Salteñas Bolivianas y la Sopa de Mani, realmente fue muy rico y delicioso, les recomiendo que si van por primera vez, pidan Las Empanadas Salteñas y les aseguro que van a pedir más.....!\n\nAclaro que hay unas mesas para comer, pero estan en la vedera de la calle.\n\nHey everyone, the Google Map communication, guys!\nWell, this time I want to give you my review of this typical Bolivian food establishment, it is in Sunnyside, Queens, NYC. I want to clarify that it is not a Restaurant to eat inside, since when you arrive at this place they only serve you through the window, you order what is on the menu and you wait for them to call you by your name.\nI also want to clarify that I have some knowledge of typical Bolivian food, that is why I am writing my review with knowledge of this delicious Bolivian food. From what I could see through the window, it is a completely family establishment, so when you go there, you will see that the meals are simple and very delicious.\nFor the first time, I ordered Bolivian Salteña Chicken Empanadas and Peanut Soup, all to take away. The waiting time to bring the food was within normal limits, a delay between 5 to 9 minutes, that's good. The girl who helped me was very kind and always provided very good attention.\nOnce I got home, we ate the Empanadas Salteñas Bolivianas and the Peanut Soup, it was really very rich and delicious, I recommend that if you go for the first time, order the Empanadas Salteñas and I assure you that you will order more... ..!\n\nI clarify that there are some tables to eat, but they are on the side of the street."

However, both the soup and the salteñas have quite a bit of vegetable, which is a bit too much for my taste. I’d personally prefer the salteñas with more meat and less veggies."

Can't wait to try the other incredible-sounding vegan and vegetarian options here!!! What a gem this place is. Cute outdoor seating (no indoor seating) and very pleasant staff. This place is best for takeout since there are not many tables outside and they're often full."

And Bros’ter Chicken strips were juicy and flavorful. But even better than the food was the service. Freddy was attentive,  made great suggestions and gave us a juice on the house.  Will definitely be back."

It was well baked, with a thin crispy/ crunchy layer and soft inside that soaked in the soup. It was juicy and the filling was delicious. I personally don’t like beans but it combined well in it.\n\nI will say overall they do the great job in deep-frying stuff! The rellenos (fried smashed potato balls) were wonderful, and I recommend the cheese one. Fries were good too.\n\nBut I vip… goes to the ice cream!!! I love love love the 💜purple corn ice cream I got! The flavor was so good with all kinds of spices."
