The first time, the food was okay, though the air conditioning wasn’t working and the place felt disorganized I decided to give them another chance thinking maybe it was just a bad day.\nUnfortunately, my second visit was even worse. The food quality had gone down a lot I got a really bad stomach ache afterward, and the naan tasted like it was frozen and reheated. For the prices they charge, the taste and freshness just don’t match up. The restaurant was uncomfortably hot again, and there was a strange smell inside that made it hard to enjoy the meal.\nOverall, I’d only recommend going here if you can’t find any other nearby option."

On top of that, the restaurant added an 18% gratuity to our bill without informing us. While the menu mentioned that gratuity would be applied, it did not specify for how many people it would apply — which is very misleading. Typically, automatic gratuity is reserved for larger groups (like 6 or more), so this felt unfair and not transparent. For the quality of food and service we received, we did not feel this was justified. Clear communication and fair billing are important."

Yesterday, my while I was enjoying the beautiful waterfront of the Brooklyn Promenades, my daughter called and asked that I purchase a few for her.  I obliged, orderd 3 galic naan's.  I was initally advised it'll take about 10 minutes but it came out faster. I was thrilled, until I got home and opened the order.  The naans were burnt, the garlic burnt.  I'm not sure that happened but my daughter and myself was not happy.   I'll give a second chance whenever i'm back downtown, since this is the first occurrence.  I hope I won't be disappointed next time."

The restaurant’s commitment to authentic flavors is evident from the first bite to the last.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala stands out, boasting tender morsels bathed in a creamy, tomato-based sauce that strikes a harmonious balance between spice and sweetness. Equally compelling is the Lamb Biryani, where fragrant basmati rice intermingles with succulent lamb, infused with aromatic herbs and spices that evoke the essence of traditional Indian cooking.\n\nVegetarian offerings are no less impressive. The Saag Paneer presents a luscious blend of spinach and paneer cheese, seasoned with garlic and herbs to elevate its earthy profile. Meanwhile, the Aloo Motor Gobi combines cauliflower, potatoes, and green peas in a medley that is both comforting and flavorful.\n\nThe ambiance at Curry Heights is inviting, providing a cozy setting that complements the culinary experience. Service is attentive yet unobtrusive, ensuring that diners feel welcomed and well-cared-for throughout their meal.\n\nIn a city teeming with dining options, Curry Heights distinguishes itself by delivering consistently high-quality dishes that honor the traditions of Indian cuisine. It’s a testament to how authenticity and passion can transform a meal into a memorable dining affair."

So I googled & try to find a desi halal restaurant to eat.\n\nWhen I went inside only thing I liked was the paintings on the wall. The decor was kinda dull, maybe the business isn’t good. But they definitely need to renovate & redecorate the restaurant.\n\nI was too tired to leave & try another restaurant! Do decided to eat anyway. The price was high & the taste wasn’t close at all. Me & my brother couldn’t even finish our one chicken biryani. I had to bring the other chicken biryani it home. The chicken loly pop  was ok.\n\nOnly thing I liked is the lady who served us. Really nice & helpful. I appreciated her service a lot. Even my kid brother also gave her tip.\n\nI hope rest of the food is better then what we tasted. Feeling real bad saying all this, maybe others will like it.\n\nFor an Indian Halal restaurant, there was not much flavor. Probably the Chef will hate me after this, maybe I should remove my pictures from the review😷But it is what it is!\n\nI was dissatisfied! My brother did mentioned that he liked the mango lassi. That’s a plus point🙏"
