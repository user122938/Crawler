Gauc, SC, cheese, and pico are extra. No chips and salsa. My friend got a salad and it came out more than 30 minutes after everyone else’s food. Guess they have to grow the lettuce. On top of that guacamole was tasteless, had to add salt and lime myself, fajitas were very chewy. Overall extremely dissatisfied. Heard great things about the place and wanted to give a try while I was in area. I do not recommend."

I'd usually get a 'girl cheese sandwich' (which I later discovered is grilled cheese). I haven't been there since sometime in the 90's. It's always held a special place in my heart and memories. Walking in there recently, I was taken away by nostalgia. Before going in, I hoped my experience wouldn't taint those memories. Let me just say, I was incredibly impressed. This crew knows what they're doing! The food was exceptional, authentic, and very fresh. Our group of three shared the chips and salsa (easily the best you'll find), ribeye tacos (probably the best tacos ever!!), chicken enchiladas, and a carb-friendly burger. I mean to tell you, everything down to the beans and rice is absolutely spot on. I was so proud to introduce my wife to this restaurant after all these years. If I could rate it 10 stars, I would! Great job everyone!!"

I quietly sent my food back with the server. I was taken back by the manager on duty for two reasons. They were apologetic and offered a free desert, however she seemed offended that I decided not to order anything else from the kitchen. Obviously the kitchen staff's hygiene weren't on point, why would I order something else? After I explained my reasons for not wanting to order anything else she proceeded to hug me without having asked. It's 2024, it's not ok to touch someone you don't know. Please respect other people's boundaries, perhaps ask if it's ok to give a hug. Server was nice, the restaurants bathroom was clean. Not coming back though, I'll go somewhere that doesn't serve hair, thanks!"

I ordered the lunch special which was chicken fried steak with fries and vegetables. I have eaten there many times, especially in the sixties. My plate arrived and looked very good I started by eating the steak first. The meat was rather thick for that type of fried steak. I didn't enjoy the steak at all. My sister said it was because I ordered brown gravy instead of white gravy. The fries were undercooked but the vegetables were great. As a practice, I never send food back I just tolerate it till I give up. This won't stop me from trying it again as this was our hangout from high school. I usually order beer with my food but this time I asked for a glass of water. Well, I feel sorry for people in Brownsville if that is what the city offers you to drink. Brings back a lot of memories going there. The people working in there were very friendly and it was very clean in the restaurant 👌."

Both were awesome. The fajita nachos had cheese on every nacho and plenty of steak to last the entire meal. The ceviche tasted amazing. If you love a strong lime-y flavor, this is the ceviche for you.\nAdditionally, the accommodations for my shellfish allergy were taken seriously, and by my lack of a reaction, their food handling is up to par. Definitely recommend visiting Vermillion ❤️"
