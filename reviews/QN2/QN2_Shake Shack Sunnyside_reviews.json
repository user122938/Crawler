Reasons I passed by for lunch of course it's Grand Opening let alone to try the Limited Time \"French Onion Soup Burger\" (size wise I got was a Double) & to also try the Limited Time \"Parmesan Garlic Fries\" that came with a Roasted Garlic Aioli Sauce Dip. I placed my order To-Go, I would've stayed but had other errands to do. Back to the food, both items were very delicious and I would recommend them to be kept on the Menu, Full Time. Welcome to Sunnyside, Shake Shack! Overall experience was Great & you can expect future visits from me."

If I’m going to pay $20.12 for a cheeseburger and fries, I will go to The Lowery in Sunnyside, where the buns are fresh and they use Pat Lafrieda beef.  $20.12 for a fast food meal, with no drink, is criminal. This will be my first and last time supporting Shake Shack. Take your money to local sunnyside establishments that actually care about the community and price their food fairly. What a waste."
