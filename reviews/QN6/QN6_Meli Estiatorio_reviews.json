The portions were very generous and flavorful — more than enough for two people to share, and we still couldn’t finish everything! Service was also very good. Overall, a wonderful experience and I will definitely be coming back."

From the moment you step inside, you’re transported to a Mediterranean paradise. The décor is breathtaking, with vibrant flowers cascading from the ceiling and a huge, inviting bar anchoring the space. A DJ was spinning great music, adding a lively, upscale vibe to the evening.\n\nThe food was nothing short of spectacular. Every dish was bursting with authentic flavors and freshness. The oysters were unbelievably fresh, the octopus perfectly tender and flavorful, and the saganaki was a showstopper. Their extensive menu of Greek specialties left us wanting to try everything. The Dover sole, however, stole the show—easily the freshest, most delicious preparation I’ve ever had.\n\nMake sure to save room for dessert because Meli’s Greek offerings are divine, the perfect sweet ending to an incredible meal.\n\nThe service was outstanding—friendly, attentive, and impressively seamless, especially for opening night. It’s rare to see a restaurant operating so smoothly right out of the gate. Plus, the added convenience of valet parking makes the experience even better.\n\nMeli Estiatorio is a must-visit for anyone craving exceptional Greek cuisine in a gorgeous setting. I can’t wait to go back!"
