The guac and chips? Criminally fresh, like Jonathan himself was back there bullying avocados into peak ripeness. My mom's burrito bowl? A disgrace - every bite balanced, seasoned, and satisfying enough to make her glare at me for trying to steal more than one forkful.\n\nAnd then there's Jonathan. The man had the gall to deliver excellent service checking in at the exact right moments, making us feel welcome without smothering us, and somehow pulling off genuine hospitality in an age of dead eyed waitstaff. It's disturbing, really.\n\nZero stars for ruining other restaurants for me. Five stars because La Sova is already living rent free in my head. Jonathan, you've officially set the bar way too high."

            "text": "We recently visited La Sova and had a very enjoyable experience. From the moment we walked in, the service stood out — friendly, prompt, and attentive without being intrusive. That kind of hospitality instantly sets the tone for a good meal.\n\nFor food, we ordered a burrito and a plate of loaded fries. The burrito was hearty with well‑balanced fillings (the wrap was fresh and wrapped nicely) and the sauces served on the side were a highlight: flavorful, well‑seasoned, and they complemented the dishes rather than overpowering them. The loaded fries were fun and indulgent — crispy fries generously topped, and again the sauces elevated the dish.\n\nThe overall vibe was relaxed and comfortable. It felt like a place you could go for a casual meal with friends and enjoy really good flavors without any pretension. Value‑wise, based on what we got and the service we received, it felt more than fair."

Although the restaurant doesn’t usually have a designated dining area, they went out of their way to set up a charming outdoor space to accommodate our family of six. This thoughtful gesture made our meal feel even more special. The food was exceptional—every dish was expertly prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and the flavors were truly memorable. Despite the unique setup, the service was flawless; the staff were attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal. The extra effort they put into making us feel welcome and comfortable did not go unnoticed. La Sova exceeded our expectations in every way, and we’ll definitely be returning. I highly recommend La Sova for anyone looking for delicious food and top-notch service, especially if you're looking for a place that goes the extra mile to accommodate its guests!"

My other most picky son who never eats out anywhere has been begging to come back every time. He got the chicken fingers and they were amazingly crispy and so good. Each one got their meals with fries as well. I absolutely love their Chinese food menu as well it’s what I always get every time I come. First two times I got the sesame chicken with fried rice and this time around I got the chicken and broccoli which also comes with fried rice!! Oh have I mentioned that the fried rice is amazing!! Generally not everyone knows how to make fried rice but at this place they definitely know what they are doing. It’s a definitely you should try! (:"

It’s the kind of place where the owner doesn’t just serve you food but is willing to chat and share the story and inspiration behind each dish. That personal touch made the whole experience feel extra special for us. We came in as a family of ten on the night before a wedding (we pretty much filled the place), and the little restaurant was filled with our laughter and plates of incredible food. The Mexican food was the favorite. The portions were generous, the prices more than fair, and every dish had us reaching across the table to share (or take) from our siblings.. The food was so good, in fact, that my daughter and new son-in-law (both gluten-free) got hungry before the wedding and ordered again the very next day for delivery, and once again, La Sova delivered (literally and figuratively). If you’re looking for authentic, fresh flavors, warm hospitality, and a place that feels like a secret worth sharing, give this place a try. It’s the kind of restaurant you’ll want to come back to and tell your friends about. Enjoy!"

The food was excellent!\nI ordered the Smash Burger which was juicy and cooked perfectly and the Beef Tacos which were very tasty and delicious. My wife ordered the Burrito and said it was one of the best things she has ever tasted! The service was excellent as well. We will definitely be ordering from here again!"

The kishka was homemade and not prepackaged and actually was also very good. The kugal was the best part of it. Both the man at the counter and someone from the kitchen who came out to ask how it was were very nice and helpful. They added a couple of tables and some chairs so was able to eat inside!"

You can get the usual things ( like hamburger) or if you want something a little more imaginative there are options like a Vietnamese rice bowl with chicken & veggies (which I got and enjoyed).

We ordered the special burger, pulled beef tacos, loaded nachos, and the beef burrito—every single dish was absolutely delicious and packed with flavor. The portions were generous, and the presentation was beautiful.\n\nWhat truly made the night stand out was the service. The owner is a true mentch and gentleman—so kind, welcoming, and attentive. He genuinely cared that we were happy with everything and went above and beyond, even giving us cornflake chicken fingers on the house (which were also amazing!).\n\nHighly recommend LA Sova for both the incredible food and the warm, top-notch hospitality. Can’t wait to come back! Thank you so much!!"
