One was occupied, and since there were three of us, we waited to use the other. While we were waiting, a staff member was unpacking sodas and placed a dirty box on the table we were clearly waiting to use. She saw us but continued without acknowledging us. Once she finished, I politely asked if they could clean the table, since the box had clearly been on the floor before.\n\nThey looked at me like I was asking for something unreasonable — as if the table looked “clean enough.” We ended up eating outside.\n\nHonestly, the lack of basic customer service skills really took away from the experience. I won’t be coming back."

As I walked in, what immediately caught my eye was a heart-shaped sign that read: \"Valentine's Day Heart-Shaped Pizza Available.\"\n\nNot only do they offer the traditional style, but Ernesto mentioned they can also make a fruit version with Nutella, strawberries, or bananas. That got me excited! The staff was warm and welcoming, making the experience even better.\n\nGravesend Pizza is located at 181 34th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11232. They serve a variety of dishes, including pastas, wraps, rolls, soups, and calzones. They even offer catering!\n\nI ordered a vodka slice, and Baby Ernesto cooked it with love. If you're in the neighborhood, this is definitely a pizza spot to add to your must-try list! 🍕❤️"

I had ordered a large cheese pizza but had to wait a few minutes because they had none available. It didn't take more than 20 minutes for the pizza to be ready.\n\nMy friend ordered a vodka pizza slice and I tasted half. It was delicious and tasty. It was filled with flavor and had the perfect amount of sauce to cheese. The plain cheese pizza came  out piping out. It was a good size and had a good amount of cheese and sauce. The sauce was fresh and looked like homemade tomato sauce. However, it lacked flavor and tasted bland. It had no salt or seasoning once so ever. I am not sure if its because they were rushing to make the pie that they forgot the spice or if that's how it is made. I wouldn't come back for the plain cheese but I would get another vodka if I was in the area.\n\nBring cash as they charge a fee for credit cards."
