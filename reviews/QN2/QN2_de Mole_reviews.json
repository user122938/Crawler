            "text": "We've been going here since they first opened 20 years ago. The food is still good but they clearly care more about money than customer satisfaction. The quality of their burritos is a prime example. What was once the best in the entire neighborhood (cost, flavor, and portion) is now a last minute resort. 15 seems reasonable for a chicken burrito but they're half the size of nearby spots like Brothers, Chipotle, and Mr Burrito (all of whom stuff your tortilla to the max). Sometimes de Mole barely adds any meat at all like other reviews have mentioned. This mostly began during COVID but has continued over the years since then. My wife still thinks they have the best tacos in Sunnyside (no longer true IMO) so we end up there a few times a month but I'd definitely recommend folks with big appetites or in search of better values to go elsewhere. You'll get more bang for your buck when dining-in but that's true for most local restaurants."

            "text": "It's a cozy place with some   different kinds of Mexiczn cuisine on offer, for example duck enchiladas. Nothing like you see on Mexico One Dish at a Time , ok, but not your average kitchen either. Mole poblano sauce was kind of thin, but still tasty. I'd recommend trying the other choices first. And it's the first restaurant I've seen in years with Negra Modelo on tap. Altogether  a good dining experience. There's a good reason they have been in the neighborhood for 18 years."

            "text": "We've been ordering from this restaurant for years, both the astoria and woodside locations, and have never had many issues. The prices have gone up but thats expected with the times, however after ordering our usual burritos ($15) for delivery yesterday, we were upset to find out that both of them, especially the carne asada burrito, was basically all rice and had maybe a few small pieces of meat inside. After calling to speak to them about it, they told us thats how it is always made and the portion given is the normal portion. This has not been an issue before and as people who order from them quite often, it seemed as though they didnt really care to make things right or listen to our complaint. Cost is cost but $15 for burritos that are 90% rice and no meat is unacceptable and we will no longer be ordering from there."

Very disappointed they took the elote (corn) from the menu.\n\nThe Ceviche was not good. It lacked the Citrus it needed. It was basically a chopped salad with a few rubber like fish pieces in it. It was not fresh and felt like it was defrosted.\n\nAdditionally everything else we ordered lacked flavor. Very different from before. I hope this place improves the quality of their food. We used to love going here and was a staple for us for dinner.\n\nService was very good. The atmosphere is very intimate. Perfect spot for a date but parking in this area is hard to find but not impossible!"

I totally recommend this place to anyone who wants real authentic Mexican food to the core. Great job de Mole, you've been and will always be a favorite of mine.\nUPDATE (pictures added): I came here once again 6/22/18 for my little ones graduation. In the photos I had an 8oz Sirloin Steak served in Chipotle sauce with rice and beans along with red sangria. As for desert, I had a tres leche cake. They did not disappoint. Order your steak right and you will be in heaven. Always keep an ear out for the specials when you visit because they are super tasty."

My husband ordered the steak burrito and I ordered the Al pastor tacos. The tacos and burrito were mediocre, I’ve definitely had better. The taco was very greasy as well.
