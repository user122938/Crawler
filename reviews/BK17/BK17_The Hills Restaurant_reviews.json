As a Guyanese person I am very embarrassed and very   disappointed with the food that I received. The jerk chicken was super salty I couldn't even eat it. It was horrible 🤮 I had to throw it in the garbage. The chow mein was bland and over cooked 😫. The BBQ chicken was edible but the beef patties didn't have any taste. We also had to throw that away. The cheese rolls didn't have enough cheese in them🤷🏾‍♂️. Like c'mon. Guyanese restaurants like this give us Guyanese people a bad name. When it comes to food only 4 Guyanese spots in the whole of Brooklyn so far that I've eaten from with good food are GT Paradise, Bamboo Garden, Linda's, and East Coast on Rogers in that order. When it comes to food, Guyanese restaurants never come up as a place people want to eat from. We have to do better and put people that can really cook good Guyanese food in the kitchen. I'm sorry for writing this long paragraph but I'm so upset 😡 that I wasted my money on this food that I couldn't enjoy. SMH. This is my first and last time coming to this restaurant. It's a big L for me. P.S fire the chef!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
