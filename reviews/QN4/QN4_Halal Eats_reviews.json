I found only couple of things special is chop cheese hero and mixed platter. The taste is different than other’s gourmet burger. The cheese burger taste is regular. Mix platter is awesome. Sitting space is very congested. It would best if you order and take out the food. Customer service needs to be improved little bit. Getting parking there is impossible. Overall a great place. Will definitely check back later."

He told me they have a food joint in new Hyde park or they are opening one this month over there. Insha Allah they open one in rockaway area Good Halal food is hard to find and get. So glad i went in to here and tried the food for the first time.\n\nAlhamdulillah"

In fact, the cozy space almost adds to the charm  it feels warm, inviting, and personal, like a place where you’re more than just another customer.\n\nThe food here is absolutely to die for. Every dish I’ve tried has been fresh, flavorful, and prepared with obvious care, but my go-to order is always the lamb gyro. It’s consistently delicious  perfectly seasoned, incredibly juicy, and bursting with flavor in every bite. The meat is tender and cooked just right, the bread is warm and soft, and the toppings and sauces tie everything together beautifully. It’s the kind of food that keeps you thinking about it long after you’ve left.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate is the staff. From the moment you walk in, you’re met with genuine smiles and a warm welcome. They don’t just take your order  they take the time to make sure you’re comfortable, answer any questions, and ensure you leave happy. I’ve been here multiple times, and without fail, the atmosphere has been friendly and inviting. You can tell they truly care about their customers, which makes the experience even better.\n\nIf you’re a fan of halal food  or even if you’ve never tried it before  I cannot recommend this place enough. It’s a must-visit spot that delivers both on quality and value. For the best deal, stop by during lunchtime when they have specials that make the experience even sweeter. Between the amazing flavors, the welcoming environment, and the great prices, this is easily one of my favorite places to eat. You won’t regret checking it out!"

Halal Eats, has this down and I was happy to spend money with them.\n\nI ordered the chicken platter with rice french fries white sauce with salad. It looks good tastes good, and there was enough for two meals. I ate some them and saved the rest for later.\n\nSince 1990 I haven't eaten pork, beef or any other red meat. It wasn't until around 1998 when I started eating poultry and fish again. Being a person who is sort of a naturopathic practitioner I'm concerned about eating clean. I've always been interested in trying out a Halal eatery, and so I decided to try Halal Eats in Elmhurst (Queens) NY. These days I'm striving to eat more fruits and vegetables than anything but now I know a go to spot when I'm in the area. On top of this the platter was under $15. In NYC to get a healthy meal, poultry, grains and salad This Was a Big Deal. I appreciated the hospitality and the good food. Just walking in the place looks like any other NYC fast food spot with a little area to eat. But the customer service and food is top notch. Stop through and get a good meal for a great price. 5 stars all the way.\n#halalfood #foodreviews #queenstakeouts #queensny #restaurantreviews #theroneshellmanmedia"

That being said, I hope you take this review as an informative review.\n\nAtmosphere: After reading the positive reviews, I've had to come to this place and see it for myself. This is quite a small place, with only four tables around and a wall mounted table. I went there after busy times and all the tables were occupied, even people that have finished their food took their sweet time to leave. A food distributor came at the same time. It was a bit uncomfortable to move around.\n\nService: To be honest, service was average. The lady said my order was going to be ready in 10 minutes and it took them almost 20 minutes.\n\nFood: I had hopes for the food to be the best part of everything. However, it came out to be average as well, not bad nor delicious. I ordered the Fish Platter and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. The sauces overshadowed the few flavors the food had. Even though I asked for little sauce on it, the lady gave me a lot.\n\nPrice: I think their prices are somewhat okay. I mean the quality and flavors of the food is okay, nothing exciting. However, personally, the factors mentioned above do not convince me to be a regular customer."

Lighting is bright and it feels like an oasis in the dark Queens Center Mall area.\n\nThe service is also quick.\n\nAll of the workers are super professional and kind.\n\nOverall a 5 star experience.

They may have a slight higher price than your average cart but they include seasoned fries and their portion is at least 40% more than your average from a cart. Also a very clean and peaceful atmosphere. The staff are extremely kind, professional and thoughtful. Loved the food and don't forget to try the green sauce!

No parking available directly at the restaurant but was able to get one nearby on a quiet, early midday. Restaurant was very clean with a modern and appealing design. Staff was friendly and service was good. Food was very delicious. Platter is comparable (based on the pri¢e$) to most other halal restaurants/carts but this included seasoned fries with it, which is a bonus for myself and others. Chicken and lamb were flavorful, juicy, and tender. Gyro and sandwiches were also delicious. Was not disappointed with this one."

In the beginning the food tasted good until I got to the bottom of my rice and it had a sour taste to it, maybe because they had salad in the same tray. So when I eat my halal I like it with white sauce, bbq sauce and a tad bit spicy. Hence their spicy sauce is SPICY! Be sure to get a drink prepared and ready to take down the spicy.\n\nSo this platter all comes with salad, rice, and seasoned fries. The portions are pretty big! Place was pretty small so it’s like playing musical chairs trying to find a seat. Wait is a bit longer because they seem to be pretty busy.\n\nOverall food was good. I recommend trying it with white sauce and bbq sauce!"

They have a sign saying paying in cash is better and they don’t charge tax but it’s incorrect, they in fact do."

We ordered one lamb platter and one chicken platter, the chicken was tasty and not dry, I loved the fries !! will visit again. One con is the size of the place, its small but otherwise 5/5."

They got few tables for people and also a standing side table for individuals. The atmosphere is good but lighting may need some alternative. Regardless, I am glad they are open til late night as me and my friends needed to get a good tea and a good food this is the place to go to!"

You wait maybe 5-10 minutes and it's done, very quick. I love this place, but only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've already gained 3 pounds from eating here so often and i'm salty about that"
