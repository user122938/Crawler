Much more traditional and better than the branch of michelin rated ramen shop closer to dumbo that closed down. Trypical menu selection got Takoyaki and Tonkotsu. Pleasant wait staff and cozy place, nice spot to grab a bite after hanging out at brooklyn bridge piers."

Small spot, adorned by wood walls and benches, super close to subway, with great food and service. Seaweed salad & Spicy Miso Ramen were both great and staff was attentive. Menu has a ton of options (from ramen to kid-friendly favorites like fries & wings), including many beers & sakes. High chairs available for the little ones. Priced for enjoyment without regret. Will definitely be back!"

Their menu isn't all that large, but that is in their favor as they, by my opinion, seem to have mastery of the deslicate art that is ramen. My first time their I took on the Red Tonkotsu Ramen, a nice creamy but heavy ramen that took on a greater level of flavor once chilli paste is added. The heat was perfect. The virtually impossible balancing act that all the ingredients take while swimming in the broth was beautifully done to such a magnificent display that most every other ramen place I have visited before has been lost to the shadow of my memory.\n\nIf I could name one negitive it would be the seating. This is probably towards persons who only share my physical issues. The indoor seats that face in foot traffic have no back support. If you can hold yourself up for to long don't sick on that side. Other then that, this place rocks."

Ramen wasn’t overly thick or spicy. Perfect balance. Pork was savory and not overly fatty. Gyoza was crispy but still tender.\n\nService was impeccable. Water stayed topped up on a hot day. Was even given green tea after finishing my meal.\n\nWorth a try if you haven’t been!!"
