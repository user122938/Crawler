Our waiter was not attentive, had two separate staff bring what we needed 1.the Bus boy brought us toast and 2.another waiter had to bring my refill apple juice. He didn’t even bother to give us eye contact or access but walked past us 4-5 times not once did he ask Is everything OK? Instead he yell\nTo us “did we get everything “ The lady at the cashier desk was apologetic and gave us cookies for the poor service"

What bothered me was at the end when our bill came the waitress added herself a tip without asking on my card. We usually leave cash tips but when she brought back my receipt the tip was already charged. I had my family there so I did not want to argue and left. I’ll be disputing the charges with my bank. Unless stated you don’t auto add tip. The receipt had the name of Kim. She was a blonde kinda tall lady."

Even though it was busy (Sunday at 11:45AM with a party of 6), we were seated quickly. The hostess was super sweet, and what seemed to be the manager was just as lovely.\n\nSome of us went for breakfast—the waffles & over-easy eggs were perfect. Great flavor, fresh, and cooked just right. My brother (a fancy foodie) got the buffalo chicken wrap and said it was amazing. My husband had the Reuben and he too was impressed.\n\nSo glad I made it back—can’t wait to return again soon. Honestly, I’d go back just for the waffles!"

I visited twice recently after I hadn't been there for awhile, since they first relocated to their current location. I ordered the Cheeseburger deluxe, which was great and it comes with steak fries. Steak fries are the best, very classic but believe it or not, not everyone has tried steak fries. I dined in and ordered an iced coffee as well. On the second visit I stopped by to get something to go, I selected a brownie and a chocolate mouse cake. They were both good and better than store bought of course."

Once I entered I felt transported to a different time. It almost feels like I walked into a movie set. It’s just feels like how a diner should feel.\nWaiter Jas seemed to be working several tables by himself but was very respectful and didn’t rush us at all. Extremely professional. 10/10.\nI ordered the chef’s omelette which was mediocre (3.5/5) - my boyfriend said his pancakes, sausage and eggs were good. Steer clear of the corned beef hash unless you like oily mushes.\n\nWould return."

These dishes seriously look like they belong in a fine dining restaurant!\n\nFrom juicy filet mignon and flavorful chicken pomodoro to crispy soft shell crabs, baked salmon, and crab claws plus diner classics like chocolate chip pancakes and a waffle sundae, this spot does it all! Every dish and baked good here is made fresh daily and from scratch!\n\nWhether you’re craving seafood, steak, or sweet breakfast bites, this Queens diner is a must-visit!"

I ordered the corned beef hash with two sunny side up eggs as it is my bench mark meal to order at a diner I have never been to. As suspected, it was prepared in the typical diner way and satisfied my morning hunger. The coffee was solid too, as you really can’t go wrong with diner coffee.\n\nWhat unexpectedly stole the show was the doily under the coffee cup. Easily the nicest, highest quality doily I’ve ever seen. It was such a small touch, but it really stood out.\n\nThe ambiance was casual and relaxed, and the service was friendly and efficient. If you’re in the area and looking for a dependable, no-frills diner, Georgia Diner delivers."

I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs, which comes with toast and potatoes, and it was honestly not that great. It was average-tasting hash that you can get from a can, and the potatoes on the side were slightly undercooked. for the price of 18$, it wasn’t that great. The rest of my table’s dishes were just average, but considering the price, it brings the rating down a bit.\n\nThe service was decent, and our waiter/busboy were attentive enough, but nothing too out of the ordinary. I will complain though, that an 18% tip was automatically added to our bill. Perhaps it was because I had a large party, but that certainly was unexpected as no one and nothing on the menu mentioned that.\n\nThe atmosphere was decent, having that classic diner feel. the bathrooms weren’t that clean, but there was nothing too bad. On a positive note, there were cookies at the register which really brought me back to other classic diners.\n\nOne final complaint is that there are two separate prices for cash and credit, with the credit being higher. If you do come, try to bring some cash.\n\noverall, Georgia Diner is decent but nothing stands out too much, and my complaints of the pricing, food, and tip put my rating lower.  Not the worst diner I’ve been to, but not the best either."

The good: I went looking for a place to eat that had a parking lot.  Georgia Diner has a BIG ONE.   This eatery is old and shows it inside and out.   As a matter of fact, once I started walking from my car, I had second thoughts about eating there.  It looks old and minimally maintained to me.  Inside, it is deceptively large.   On a diet,  I only glanced at the deserts up front.   Typical Diner choices.   Ordered and pictured  was a grilled chicken salad and the Greek gyro without the white sauce.   The salad got rave reviews from my friend.   The chicken breast was cooked well and juicy.  My gyro actually concerned me a little bit.  The lettuce and tomatoes looked not spoiled but not the freshest either.  The gyro meat had strange light colored circles in it.  I know the meat is processed, but I had never seen   it look so unappealing before.   Whatever it was, it was not bad  but not great either.   As I looked at other meals being delivered, they all seemed large and well adorned.   The service was adequate.   Nice enough lady and no gaps in service.\nThe bathroom was not dirty but  not fresh.   The floor was sticky like the last show at a movie theater.  This really turned me off.  The two meals were a modest $35, which these you get what you pay for I recon.  I certainly would not rush back there myself.   Your mileage may vary..."

I chose stuffed and I swear that crab stuffing was phenomenal. My main issue was the lack of follow up. We had to flag down a busser for water refills, everything was salty like I like but water is a necessity. Then after we were done eating (and looking for him for 20 min) my husband caught our waiters attention to ask for the check and he acknowledged then went into the kitchen for about 15 minutes. He just seemed to have checked out. Also, don’t order the chili, it was weirdly sweet and gave us horrible gas pains."

            "text": "Plenty of free parking. Waiter seemed annoyed & was bit rude immediately. The Chicken & Waffles was very dry & bland. Some of the chicken was so thin the texture was awful. The cuppacino was bland. The restaurant looked nice inside but overall had a weird vibe with the mood of the overall staff. My waiter never even came to check on me until I was done eating. Waste of money."

The service is warm and hospitable, and the atmosphere is really nice. Definitely try the strawberry cheesecake, it’s fresh, creamy, and absolutely delicious!"

Spinach was ok but no mushrooms and tomatoes. In the coffee found piece of paper at the bottom. Spoken to manager who could not to listen to me giving his ideas about coffee with paper. Very disappointed 😞"

            "text": "Make sure you check all the prices on the menu first! They will charge extra for everything.\n\nFirst, the waitress Silvia was rude. She gave us cold coffee and when we asked why, she said \"that's what's in the pot\". She didn't even try to fix it. Then we ordered French toast and strawberries, which was already 16 dollars for 2 pieces, and we asked for turkey sausage, and they charged 8 dollars! 8 dollars I've never seen that. For 3 little pieces of sausage. And an extra 4 dollars for the turkey bacon my mom asked for with her order. We proceeded to speak to the manager, and he did not even care. When my father went to speak to him about the other extra charge after, he dismissed him and said he had already spoken to the lady (me) and didn't even hear him out came back to our table took the bill angrily and took off the Turkey sausage. If you don't care about your customers, why work in a restaurant. Disgusting service. Our first time there and we won't be back! The diner wasn't even busy and 3:30 pm."

            "text": "A very typical diner with great menu selections. Normally, I don’t like to go to diner but wanted to give this a try, since we always pass by here on our way back from Queens Blvd. As a party of 2 adults and 1 preschooler, we got waffle with chicken tenders (the tenders were amazingly juicy), salad(forgot what we got but the portion size was WOW), sausage & eggs, mussel pasta, clam chowder, cappuccino, all come with very big portion and we also got bread for free. All three of us left with very full stomach and had to get to go, we did order a lot though. Honestly the food wasn’t that great great but definitely above average and beyond my expectation. The bill was surprisingly reasonable, with all these, we ended up paying $80ish. Will def return."

I like that it's a big place so you don't have to sit too close to others (partitions between booths) or even wait long for a table.\n\nUpdate: Also, a great place to go for a quick late meal / snack on a Saturday night.  Large diner plenty of seating and they're super accommodating for picky eaters."

            "text": "I've been here a few of times and it has always been good until today July 5th 230pm. My waiters of middle eastern ethnicity was my waiters and I must say he is a total mess, the only reason the only thing that was good was the clam chowder is because that probably wasn't made by the waiter or chef and it comes from a bag. The waiter doesn't know the difference between a chicken souvlali and a gyro is yet he tried to convince me they are the same. Now both are made with chunks of skewered chicken but they gave me a grilled chicken in a gyro when all I wanted was a chicken souvlaki platter, my wife ordered a cheeseburger and brought her a dried piece of meat with cheese on burger bread, no lettuce, no tomatoes, mayo, no fries with her platter, the carbonara was bad, we got a plate of fruits with yogurt, honey and walnuts for my baby and requested fruits and yogurt in separate plate and the guy brought it all together. Horrible experience, waiter and chef should be oriented If not fired. I should have known better when I saw the person next to me when they left their food on the plate."
