Not worth buying from them overpriced. The meatball i bought looked old and tasted weird. Their food quality is no where near the price the got on them. Very disappointed, I don't recommend anyone to buy here at this place. I honestly dont judge anything for its price but i literally got to taste it and it wasnt good at all Waste of money."
