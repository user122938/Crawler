            "text": "I stopped by Kyuramen and ordered the Curry Ramen and an Iced Thai Tea, and both really hit the spot. The curry ramen had a rich, flavorful broth and savory with just the right amount of spice. The noodles were perfectly chewy, and the tender slices of pork soaked up the curry flavor nicely. It’s a comforting bowl that balances warmth and spice without being overwhelming. The Iced Thai Tea was creamy and refreshing, with that signature sweet, slightly earthy flavor that pairs perfectly with a salty, savory dish. The atmosphere was cozy with a modern Japanese feel which is great for solo dining or a casual hangout. Service was quick and friendly, and everything came out fresh and hot. Overall, Kyuramen delivered a satisfying, flavorful meal that I’d definitely order again especially on a cold day!"

The ramen broth had that perfect balance of richness without being too heavy, and the noodles were cooked just right.\n\nThe place itself is really nice and clean, with a cozy vibe that makes it great for both a quick meal or hanging out with friends. The staff were also really friendly and attentive—they checked in just the right amount without being overbearing, which I appreciate.\n\nOverall, Kyuramen’s definitely one of my new favorite ramen spots in Queens. Highly recommend if you’re craving something warm and delicious!"

Whether it’s Flushing, Bayside, Long Island City, or Forest Hills, each visit feels like coming home to a familiar, comforting meal.\n\nMy staple order is always the Yin Yang Ramen Bowl, which beautifully combines two different broths in one — one spicy, one mild. It’s the best of both worlds. Each side is deeply flavorful, rich, and balanced, and the portions of meat and veggies are generous. The presentation is always on point, but it’s the taste that keeps me coming back.\n\nI unfortunately suffered a loss today and grieving - honestly, there’s nothing quite like a hot, savory bowl of ramen from Kyuramen to soothe an aching heart. There’s comfort in the routine of that first sip of broth — it’s like being wrapped in warmth and familiarity.\n\nKyuramen isn’t just a place to eat; it’s a small reminder that even in hard times, simple pleasures like good ramen can make things a tiny bit better."

While the $6 combo deal (including a pork bun and Thai milk tea) is tempting, the pork bun itself was just okay.\n\nWhat really stood out was the attentive service and the trendy ambiance definitely Instagram worthy!

The service is friendly and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. They are not overly bothersome, only tending to you at your request.\n\nAs for the food, it’s solidly average. While there’s nothing particularly wrong with the dishes, it doesn’t stand out either. The menu has a decent variety, but the flavors don’t quite stand out from other ramen places.\n\nIf you’re looking for a spot to enjoy a pleasant environment with good company, this place fits the bill. Just don’t go in expecting a culinary revelation.\n\nThe gyoza was a dish that I enjoyed the most."

The restaurant boasts a pristine, inviting atmosphere, with modern renovations that enhance the dining experience.\n\nAbout the omurice, its presentation was stunning, adding an element of ceremony to the meal, the flavor fell slightly short of expectations.\n\nHowever, the miso and chashu ramen were exceptional—rich, flavorful broths that were elevated further by the addition of the Japanese spicy powder available at the table.\n\nThe seafood rice bowl also turned out to be a delightful surprise, and the matcha pudding with red beans provided the perfect conclusion to the meal. The service was impeccable, with warm, attentive staff who ensured we were comfortable throughout the visit.\n\nOverall, Forest Hill KyuRamen offers an excellent dining experience, and I highly recommend this location for anyone seeking quality ramen and a welcoming atmosphere."

            "text": "UPDATE: After another visit, I tried the fried chicken rice sandwich. I liked it! The chicken was moist and crispy with a nice sauce. The sweet potato fries are amazingly delicious. My only complaint is that the sandwich can be a bit messy (the servers provide us with disposable gloves). For me it, I had a hard time assembling the sandwich because the rice was stuck to the seaweed.\n\nA fine place for a bowl of ramen!\n\nWe had the meal for two for $56, which I think is a good deal for what it is.\n\nThe ramen was really good! I think the spicy ramen is way better than the non-spicy. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I would like. But the noodles, pork, and garnish in the ramen bowl were delicious.\n\nThe Thai tea is refreshing and delightful.\n\nPopcorn chicken was okay. I think it could have been crispier.\n\nThe desserts were really nice! It wasn't too sweet and it was a great end to the meal.\n\nService is great.\n\nWould recommend!"

Kyuramen with it's seafood option was able to dodge that trap and combine flavor, taste and nutrition. Glad I checked this place.\nThey should offer an option of ice cream flavors mix. There's no reason you must have 2 scoops of the same flavor."
