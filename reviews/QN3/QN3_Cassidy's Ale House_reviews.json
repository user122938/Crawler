We stop by for most family birthdays and occasions. We even held my mom's 60th birthday in the back room and had the whole thing catered for super reasonable cost. We held a paint and sip back there. The food is super tasty. I'm obsessed with the garlic mushrooms and I spent most of my life thinking I didn't like mushrooms! The steak tidbits are mouth watering. There are always interesting locals seated at the bar and happy groups seated around the tables. It's a great atmosphere. Owner and staff are friendly and warm."

Nothing was to rave about as the drinks and food were just fine. The burger was just a bit dry and the fries were lacking a bit of flavor besides the bacon. The onion rings were really good though, perfectly fried and didn't have a bad oily flavor. The drinks were ok as well, I had an Old Fashioned that was good but it had just a little too much bitters. Our bartender was really nice, he chatted with us as we sat at the bar - mostly because there was nothing else to do since there were only two other people in the bar!\nAll in all, it was a typical bar. It didn't necessarily stand out but it wasn't a bad restaurant either."
