            "text": "!! BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER HONEY !!\n\nSo Taverna Kyclades used to be on Ditmars between 33rd and 35th Street.. small, cozy, and family-oriented. Sure, it was tight, but it felt like sitting down in someone’s Greek grandma’s living room. You had to fight for a reservation, but honestly, that was part of the charm.\nNow?? They moved to a corner spot on Ditmars and 36th. You’d think “new, bigger, better!”\nWRONG.\nInstead, they plopped this wholesome family restaurant right into club central, literally across from Tru Astoria (which, btw, is basically a club that pretends it’s a restaurant… story for another day). So instead of a chill family vibe, you’re now dining with car horns, drunk laughter, and bass from across the street.\nAnd let’s talk about the menu: half the items don’t even have prices listed. Like… am I at a restaurant or Sotheby’s?\n\nPRO TIP: bring a fat wallet, because friends of mine have dropped $200 on one fish. ONE. FISH. Honey, for $200 that fish better sing me a song and tuck me into bed at night. Meanwhile, you could literally walk to any Astoria fish market, grab the same type of fish, season it, toss it in the oven, and call it a day for $30.\nNow, not everything’s bad, the calamari is AWESOME. And I take my calamari very seriously. It’s the one dish every seafood place should get right, and thank Poseidon, they nailed it.\nSo yeah, if you go, read the menu beforehand, brace your wallet, and maybe bring earplugs. It’s not bad, but it definitely isn’t the cozy little spot it once was."

We were thrilled with what arrived. Octopus also tends to be my litmus test for a great restaurant with seafood speciality. They hit it out of the park. Fantastic. Portions leave you well fed and they even have very nice mixes for non alcohol drinks using herbs and ginger. Love it. I highly recommend this place. Nights out are meant to be special and this dinner was memorable. Staff was gracious and sat us without any fuss as walk in on a busy night. Will definitely return."

Not only because of the amazing food, but also because of the warm, family-like atmosphere that makes every visit special.\n\nThe food is always outstanding — fresh, flavorful, and authentically Greek. Every dish, from the seafood and fish to the salads and sides, is prepared with care and consistency. You can truly taste the quality and dedication in every bite.\n\nBut what truly makes Taverna Kyclades exceptional is the people who work there.\nI want to give special recognition to Stefano, the manager, whose professionalism, kindness, and attention to detail shine through in everything he does. His leadership creates the welcoming environment that keeps customers coming back year after year.\nAlso, a big thank-you to Claire, always warm, elegant, and greeting everyone with a genuine smile; to Evangelis, who provides excellent, attentive service every single time; and to Peter, whose friendliness and great attitude make every visit even better.\n\nWe also want to thank all the staff members, from the kitchen to the servers and everyone working behind the scenes. Each of them contributes to the restaurant’s success through their hard work, dedication, and positive energy.\n\nAnd, of course, our sincere congratulations to the owner of Taverna Kyclades. You’ve done an outstanding job selecting such a talented, kind, and professional team. It’s clear that everyone here cares deeply about what they do — and that’s what makes this place so special.\n\nAfter so many years of coming here, I can honestly say that Taverna Kyclades is much more than just a restaurant — it’s a place where we always feel welcomed, appreciated, and part of the family.\n\nThank you to Stefano, Claire, Evangelis, Peter, and the entire team for so many years of excellence, warmth, and dedication. And congratulations to the owner for creating something truly exceptional.\n\nWith appreciation and gratitude,\nNéstor Meléndez & Family 💙🇬🇷"

It’s better to wait for an outside table.\n\nWe got a lot of food, but we only really liked the salad and the saganaki. The Santorini shrimp was burnt, the fish was badly overcooked, and the fried calamari was pretty good. The octopus was also burnt. The waiter kept checking on us to see if everything was okay, but how was I supposed to tell him everything tasted burnt? Maybe it was just bad luck, but it definitely wasn’t what we expected."

            "text": "My family and I had high expectations of this restaurant. First things first be prepared to wait at least an hour. Second, please beware of any items labeled MP on the menu, if you don’t want any surprises, ask for the price in advance! We asked our server George, what the difference between the red and pink snapper were. He said, the difference is that pink snapper is bigger and feeds 2 to 3 people and the red is more for one person. He also insisted that the pink snapper is a very good choice, strongly insisting we would love it because he thinks it’s the best fish and is a greek favorite, so we got it.\n\nFast forward to the bill and i was shocked that 1 item made up close to half of the bill. I didn't even order any drinks! There is no fish on God’s green earth worth $200 dollars but according to this restaurant and george, the pink snapper is worth just that. I could have gladly gone to Lugers, ordered a porterhouse and been much more satisfied. Extremely underwhelming.\n\nIf I must be honest everything else was ok, the salad was good, the lemon potatoes were good, the octopus was good, the greek sausages were good, the rice was good, the scallops were good, and the calamari was decent. It’s a shame, that one fish made this experience not feel worth it.\n\nI’d also like to note that we sat outside and saw a flying cockroach on the wall behind us, so i’m honestly not surprised at the most recent review which highlights such a horror. So unfortunate. Good luck to whomever decides to go here."

The waiter was amicable but didn’t mention price point when explaining the difference between a red snapper and a pink snapper. He recommended it to us and was super selling us on this fish. The price on the menu was marked as “MP” which we thought okay it would be reasonable. When we got the bill, the pink snapper was $200! One fish was $200.\n\nIf you’re thinking of having good seafood, please opt for HAMIDOS. The scallops, lobster tail and red snapper at Hamido’s is much better."

The tzaziki, bread, tapenade, wines, dessert all incredible. huge portions. Friendly efficient service.\n\nCons: on top of it being insanely loud there was also techno music playing, very overstimulating and impossible to have a conversation, salmon needed more flavor and was not deboned, which made eating it a chore.\n\nI 100% will be back but maybe sit outside next time bc of the loud noise and techno"

It was fine the area has a lot to see and do, so we walked around. We had the village salad, Kyclades special (seafood platter),grilled chicken, rice, and potatoes. There was only 2 of us, and enough food to feed 4! Each bite was better than the next! All the food was fresh and delicious, and reasonable! We will be going back a lot! Great Greek food!🇬🇷"

The service was impeccable—every staff member, even those who weren’t our primary server, made sure we had everything we needed.\n\nFor appetizers, we enjoyed crab cakes with fried zucchini. For dinner, my husband had a white fish stuffed with crab meat, while I had a pasta dish featuring five types of seafood: octopus, mussels, clams, scallops, and shrimp. Every bite was full of flavor, and the portions were incredibly generous—we had to take half of our food home and enjoyed it for a couple more days!\n\nOverall, the combination of excellent service, delicious food, and large portions made this a truly delightful dining experience."

            "text": "Absolutely worth the trip. Amazing food, wine, service and vibe. Got their assortment of dips, octopus, and this shrimp and tomato dish that was very good. The Greek salad is so simple but so delicious. Their portions are generous and they give you a dessert on the house. We also got their bottle of Caterina Sauvignon Blanc which was bright and slightly sweet. Highly recommend and will definitely go back.\n\nWent back and tried their grilled clams and sea bass. Sea bass was very tender and I liked that there was a lot of meat to the fish. They didn't have the fried sardines so instead we tried their fried whiting which was a good alternative white fish."

Was told one hour 20 minute wait for inside or outside could be seated immediately. Luckily I read about their blankets because they were needed!!! Service was just okay but the busser was killing it. All over our table with water, bread, boxing up leftovers, whatever. Food is plentiful and incredibly good. Had the village salad, spanikopita, chicken souvlaki and seafood pasta. All were absolutely delishhhhhh. Inside was jammed. Long line for the bathroom too!! Can’t wait to go back! Easy walk from the N train. Excellent visit!"

            "text": "This place was super cute!!! My friend and I just finished watching a movie and came in around 9:20pm for a table and it was still PACKED, especially outside. We ordered a small greek salad and the kyclades special (for 2) with a side of lemon pepper potato wedges. It was MORE than enough food for the both of us! We didn't care for the baked class, but we loved everything else. The seafood was super fresh. The lobster tail was perfectly cooked, first time having filet of sole. Now I like and will order that type of fish and the small greek salad was definitely enough for 3 or even 4 (shareable so everyone has some) highly recommend and would DEFINITELY come again. They also gave us a free dessert at the end which was phenomenal and a surprising touch. Overall 2 thumbs up and many yum yums"

We got the whole fish (black sea bass) deboned but there were still some bones but it was pretty decent. The scallop dish was a ton of scallops! What a delight. The lemon potatoes were very flavored and very soft. Also their Greek salad was somehow just so yummy.\nAt the end we got some traditional custard dessert. Overall we were very happy and satisfied.
