From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with exceptional warmth and hospitality that made me feel like I was home.\n\nTheir signature House special MaMa Noodle Soup is absolutely phenomenal. The beef is perfectly braised until tender, practically melting in your mouth. Paired with springy hand-pulled noodles, fresh vegetables, marinated egg, and a rich, flavorful broth, every bite was a comforting explosion of flavor.\n\nIt’s no surprise that The New York Times has recommended this place—it truly lives up to the hype!\n\nIf you’re in NYC and craving a bowl of soulful, authentic Chinese beef noodle soup, Mama’s Noodle House is a must-visit."

            "text": "Cute small shop tucked away in the corner of a street. The restaurant is small maybe barely 500 sq ft but on a cold rainy day when we visited, it felt welcoming and warm. Although there are no fancy decorations nor furniture, we opted to dine in since there weren’t others when we visited. We did see multiple people coming in for take out orders. The ambiance feels like a small coffee shop/food stall with window seating but instead they serve delicious comfort Chinese food.\n\nWe got:\n- House special Mama Noodle  10/10\n- Basil Chicken Ho Fun                10/10\n- Herbal Tea                                  10/10\n\nEverything was so tasty here. It’s the perfect comfort food. The Mama Noodle is the best version of beef noodle soup I’ve had. I never liked how simple beef noodle soup is but this version is loaded with everything. You not only get the tender & juicy beef cube and homemade noodles - you also get curry fish balls, tofu, hard boiled eggs, topped with plenty of vegetables! It’s so good especially on a cold rainy day. The perfect dish.\n\nWe wanted to try a dry noodle dish as well and the basil ho fun was delicious! One of the highlight was the house made (ground pork/shallot?) chili sauce that she gave to us along with some black vinegar. Definitely ask for some of that sauces with any order!! It tastes good on everything….\n\nThe herbal tea has the right mixture of bitter and sweet. Other places either have it too sweet or too bitter. It’s so satisfying to wash down everything with the herbal tea at the end of the meal.\n\nBefore you go, don’t forget to grab some frozen house-made dumplings to cook for later. We got 30 pieces and it was only $12. The owners were very generous with the fillings. I never want to buy frozen dumplings from grocery stores anymore!\n\nYou have these options:\n- shrimp wonton\n- pork dumpling\n- pork chive dumplings\n\nThe shrimp wonton and the pork chives are my favorite!"

Sometimes takeout, sometimes dine in. Mama is a real mama, sometimes I stop by to say hi just to feel a bit of her positive energy. She's very generous and so nurturing you can feel it in the food. I always come out feeling like I've been fed by my own mom.\n\nEveryone should try Mamas at least once in their lives. I usually get the shrimp dumpling in different form or the ma po tofu with rice."

            "text": "The restaurant is located in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.  They prepare Chinese cuisine.  It is very small and located on the side street.  They have several tables for dining in but is basically a takeout.  I ordered the scallion pancake which was thin and flaky.  The curry fish balls were interesting and were in a curry sauce similar to Indian cuisine.  The wonton noodle soup was good but had little soup.  I would recommend additional soup in a separate container.  The hot pot shrimp had a loose spicy sauce with small shrimp and some vegetable.   The mapo tofu was on rice and had a good taste.  The woman answering the phone spoke limited English but was friendly.  I asked for some additional sauces  but it was left out of the order.  They also don't take credit cards which can be inconvenient."

I went there with my sister and we got the wonton and dumplings noodle soup and the hot pot style noodle. The hot pot style noodle tasted pickled which my sister was not a fan of but that’s just taste preferences. It wasn’t that spicy but it was still good. The wontons also had shrimp in it but since I am allergic to crustaceans I couldn’t eat all of them sadly and gave them to my sister. They were still good and they were handmade which was cool. The noodles in the wonton noodle soup were soft and came with a very mild and nice soup."

At first, this seems like it is just for take out but if you go by yourself or with a small party (less than 5), you might be lucky to eat in. Why eat in? Food is always best when eaten fresh. Take out can never compare.\n\nI went here with two friends and we were blown away by the hospitality shown by the owners and the quality of the noodle soups. This is truly a hidden gem for those who loves a good noodle soup! Eat in if you are the type who loves hole-in-the-wall spots and don't mind the atmosphere, or else just do take out."

Walking in you are instantly greeted with a warm smile by the owners and provided with menus. All the food looked very good so it was hard to decide on something. On top of that the prices are very reasonable. I went with the dumpling noodle with a lemonade to drink. Besides the fact that the dumplings and noodles were so so good, a portion size for two honestly, the lemonade got me hooked. It is freshly made and served in a very cute cup and straw combo. I highly recommend this place and will be coming back for more. Thank you!!!"
