When our waitress asked if I would like the turkey bacon well done I hesitated for a moment, I had never been asked that before. Since she stumped me I obliged and I am so happy I did because the cook on that turkey bacon was EVERYTHING. It had a beautiful char and smoky flavor without being burnt or too crunchy.
