With 160 bucks, you can get great amount of sushi and sashimis plus steak dinners and other noodle dishes in our beautifully decorated restaurant. Recently, when we dined in there for dinner of 4, we only ordered two vegetarian dish and fish egg drop soup and a plain sautéed fish. And the bill was like 160. Adding 20% tip.

            "text": "Extremely Disappointed with Birthday Dinner Experience\n\nI rarely leave negative reviews, but the way I was treated during what was supposed to be a special birthday dinner was unacceptable and unprofessional.\n\nI made a reservation in advance and specifically noted that it was for a birthday celebration. I expected at least a basic level of acknowledgment — a simple greeting or just courteous service. Instead, the staff seemed unaware and uninterested. No one even acknowledged the occasion, despite me mentioning it again upon arrival.\n\nI’m absolutely appalled by the way this restaurant handled my family’s birthday dinner, especially regarding the longevity peach buns (壽桃包)that I pre-ordered well in advance.\n\nThese buns were not just a dessert — they were a symbolic and meaningful part of the celebration for an elderly family member. I confirmed the order at the restaurant , made sure they had all the details, and was told everything was set. But on the day of the dinner, they flat-out lied and said they didn’t have any left.\n\nI have every reason to believe they gave them to someone else, possibly a larger or “more important” party, and just assumed we would quietly accept it. That’s not just unprofessional — it’s completely disrespectful. If you can’t honor a simple pre-order, don’t pretend to offer the service at all.\n\nNeedless to say, this ruined what should have been a memorable evening. I will not be returning, and I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for thoughtful service or a place to celebrate special occasions."

Complimentary mango dessert, almond cookies, and assorted fruit.

The piss that gets on the bottom of men's shoes is tracked into the dining room where the glass rotating tabletops are placed on their sides as table cloths are changed. Think of someone pissing on your table for imagery. Seriously, a restaurant that does such high volume should have an attendant in the bathroom, or, I'd say, minimally, a sanitizing floor mopping once every couple of hours. If the rest rooms are a measure of the care that the ownership takes in the kitchen ... well, you can imagine. So, cleanliness: Zero stars. The two stars are for the food. Assuming it's clean (a dubious assumption), it's perhaps the best Cantonese food in recent memory. I'm not an expert, but I've had a lot of authentic Cantonese food. The service is passable - but verges on hostile."

We didn't notice at first until a droplet splashed into the soup and splashed every until we noticed. It may have went into the other food without us realizing. The water kept dropping and the staff didn't do anything. We just had to move the table to the left corner so we weren't in the splash zone. Not only was sewage water splashing into the food, the soda we were severed was over a year expired. Who knows what else is expired or fresh. I am never returning to this restaurant."
