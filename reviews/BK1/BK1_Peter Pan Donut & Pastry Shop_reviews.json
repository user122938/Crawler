            "text": "I was ready to be absolutely blown away by the doughnuts here and bought two to test both. Firstly, and perhaps my fault, the offer wasn’t as broad as I’d hoped due to selling out. I really wanted to try glazed/plain plus one of the jam options that I did try. On both doughnuts the pastry was exceptional - mixture of light and full of flavour. Jam was too much for me - felt too processed/thick/sugary. It’s a good offer so I’d recommend trying. Queue is long but moves quick so don’t be put off by that."

The service is absolutely horrible, I understand that the girls can be overwhelmed because it does get very busy but they all come across as VERY rude and not helpful. The hiring of some of the girls seems rushed as they don’t seem properly trained for the crowds as well as having trouble doing the math to give you the PROPER change back (since it is a cash only establishment) they want to get you out of there as soon as possible and will give you an attitude if you take too long to decide. lastly,  CHECK YOUR ORDER before you leave everytime because recently I have been coming home from here and get the completely wrong thing from what i asked for!!!"

The staff came across rude. I question the cleanliness of this establishment. It could use some updating on the decor - seems aged but not in a way I find appealing. I asked to use the restroom before leaving which they allowed (I was grateful too as I know most places do not allow this) but as the staff led me to the restroom she went inside and closed the door in my face without a word. Left me in the back of the kitchen aimlessly with no where to stand and no direction on what's next. Turns out she decided to use the restroom before me. Would have been nice for her to atleast ask me to wait there a minute. This is probably a place better to grab and go rather than dine in. Idk it wasn't my cup of tea and definitely did not have a magical PeterPan vibe to live up to such a name."

Mike’s Donuts in Bay Ridge definitely does a better blueberry donut.\n\nThe apple crumble donut, though, totally saved the experience. It was excellent — the apple filling and pie crumb topping worked perfectly together, and it wasn’t overly sweet. Definitely the highlight.\n\nFrom what I saw (and tasted), their cake donuts seem to run on the dry side. I’d stick to their yeast donuts instead, since the sour cream, old fashioned, and chocolate cake donuts all looked dry too.\n\nCustomer service was fine — not rude, but I did have to flag someone down to get served once seated.\n\nOverall: 3/5."

Imagine the kitchen door wide open behind where your sitting and you hear the manager screaming so loud at his own team. The other guests around me stopped doing what they were doing and we all just looked at each other. I don’t know what the reason was nor do I care, that is NO way to speak to people. Literally felt like I was listening to someone who lacked so much emotional maturity lead a team that was just confused. His energy killed my vibe. Won’t be recommending anyone here. Hopefully the team members who had to deal with that won’t have to deal with it much longer."

The service was iffy at best; teenage girls behind the counter the girl who helped me looked like they were definitely in high school. Had to ask questions more than once because it seemed like she spaced out and wanted to be anywhere else but there. The positives: the egg cream and the Red Velvet doughnut were so good! I can’t state how great it was. On the downside the french cruller was just straight up nasty. They definitely used dirty oil and it was absolutely the only thing you could taste. I can’t describe how bitter it was from the oil that it was one bite and in the trash. I guess you win some you loose some. It was a nice one experience but I wouldn’t go out of the way to try a doughnut from here"

I was hoping to order an apple fritter, but they ran out, so I ordered a honey dip and a lemon filled donut, which was generously filled. The texture of the donuts was soft and chewy, making it a perfect snack! I loved the old-fashioned diner vibes with the barstools and decor. This joint was reasonably priced, especially considering the price of quality pastries in NYC, but I would definitely recommend visiting early in the morning for a greater selection of flavors. I would definitely recommend visiting Greenpoint Toys across the street with its wide array of toys for all ages."

            "text": "excellent yeasted donuts! would recommend the coconut cream and honey dip donuts for sure - especially the latter if you like plain glazed donuts. i was afraid the coconut cream was going to be too heavy or too sweet but it was actually quite light and fluffy. the red velvet and sour cream donuts were pretty good as well, but we just aren't big fans of cake donuts. one of the servers offered us water when she saw us eating the cake donuts which was a nice gesture. cumulatively this came out to under 8 dollars. would go again for the yeasted donuts!"

            "text": "I’ve been coming here for ages, before the lines would wrap around outside. It’s delicious and worth it. I just popped in for a coconut cream donut, it was so delicious and not cloyingly sweet the way many other places can be. It was delicious, and had nice fluffy coconut flakes on the top. My dad’s favorite from here was the crumb cake. You can see a huge slab of it when you walk in. Some additional notes, there is some seating here but it is limited. There’s also bagels of course and breakfast sandwiches such as the bacon egg and cheese that I didn’t notice referenced anywhere in the store menus, but a guy seated there was enjoying one and another nearby child told his mom he wanted one too. Such a great classic spot in the neighborhood, they’ve been here for a while and it shows, great quality. The lines can be crazy but they move faster than you’d think, just plan accordingly, also CASH ONLY! They mention it many times in there but I will too!"

If you are a tourist, sure it's worth a visit. But if you were born and raised in NY, you would not be wowed."

Walk inside to be greeted by a good line, classic donut, shop, counter, seating, and a bunch of ladies and old school uniforms, eager to help you choose your sweet culinary delight. Strongly recommend the sour cream donut, coffee cake, and cream chocolate sprinkle (reminds me of an old school 7 minute frosting with sprinkles on top). Also the best French crueler I’ve ever had in my life. Went on a Saturday and Monday this go round and it’s fun as a visitor seeing the difference between the Saturday crowd (super busy and lots of visitors) versus Monday (more locals on their way to work and folks who know each other). The world needs more places like Peter Pan Donut."

            "text": "I really liked Peter Pan bakery! This is a classic bakery with a vintage 1950s vibes to it. Whenever I come here, I always get the red velvet donut, which is delicious. This donut is not too messy and has a classic taste to it. This place can get very busy at times and usually has a long line. It is also really hard to find seating in the bakery since all the seats are usually taken. But waiting on the line for 10-15 minutes is worth it since the donut is really good and really priced well. The donuts are only $1.25 and also tastes really well! These donuts beat Dunkin Donuts any day, and has a better classic and authentic taste to it. It’s also much cheaper than Dunkin Donuts as well.\n\nPrice:$1.25💸\nRating: 8/10📝"

All of the ladies working were so sweet and gave good suggestions. We sat at the counter and had our food in no time. I got a cream cheese and lox bagel, and my partner had an egg and cheese. I’m going to dream about that bagel for years to come! We also grabbed a half dozen doughnuts to go. Every staff member was friendly, helpful, and on point. Highly recommend adding to your to-try list!"

It seems MOST of their donuts have some kind of cream in it, their red velvet with white icing on top tasted so off.\nI mean I guess.  I wouldn’t go back though."
