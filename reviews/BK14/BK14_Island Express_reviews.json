Their staff is always great! I was helped by two gentlemen the other day, one of them resembled the late rapper Nipsey Hussle, which they both were so kind and patient as i always get a lot of bakery items each time I go. The other day I was a little disappointed in the cheese rolls, as they were kinda hard and didn't taste fresh like they normally do, everything else was fine and tasted great!\nI also got a peanut punch which was pretty tasty, maybe a little more nutmeg than what I'd prefer, but still was pretty good."

So I chose the plantain & okra, they barely had plantains, was embarrassing so I told him it’s fine, no plantains & then he put back rice from my bowl back into the pot to make room for the pepper pot, I was so disgusted & annoyed I had to walk out. I’ll try again next time."

The first impression of the place was positive but when you are dealt with the staff especially if you are LGBT,  you would not get a good experience.  This place seem to only cater to good looking women and not people as a whole. The lack of customer service is seen especially in the younger male workers who you can tell have something against thr LGBT community, it's very serious especially being that we live in 2024. Now to actually rate the item I got! It was horrible, it give guyanese bread a bad name. I ordered the butter bread and it was the most stale piece of bread I ever tasted. Please do not think this is how Guyanese bread taste, this place is giving it a bad name. They really need to study their recipes.  If you want some good Guyanese Bread, please go to Bakewell, then you can make your opinion on Guyanese Bread. Overall, I was totally disappointed in thr way i was treated and the way the bread was stale. Never giving my business here again.\n\nUPDATE: Toasting bread with some butter makes it a little better so my advice is to toast it before eating it."

The okra was a little tough in some parts but otherwise everything was excellent. Really great flavors that come together well. I also got a cocktail beef patty and guava tart which were also excellent. Will definitely be coming back!"

However, each bite made me want to literally vomit. The pepper pot was disgusting, poorly seasoned. The okra was tough in some spots. The tamarind sauce was rancid. This place is like the school cafeteria version of Caribbean food. What an unfortunate and highly disappointing waste of money, time and taste buds."

They run out of their plantains so be ready with a back up for side options. The prices to portions are great, I paid $15 for oxtail and $11 for goat curry. One dish is definitely enough to fill you up. The only thing I'd change is I wish the oxtail leaned in to the taste of the beef more with a stronger, more savory flavor instead of cinnamony sweet. I also wish the guava tarts had more filling and were softer."

I requested pepper and nothing came with it. At least if I had some pepper it would have gave the food a likkle flavor. The spinach was full of oil; just drenched. And the tamarind was sour skunt. The chow mein in mek it. I spent $41 for exactly what?! I will be disputing with Uber. Definitely will not be ordering again from this establishment."

Great modern update of Sybils a family owned store that  relocated and rebranded itself with a fresh new look and attitude.\n\nThe menu explains what all of the tasty items are and there is a separate line for both hot prepared foods & baked goods. This is a rarity in NYC establishments and makes service speedy and efficient.  Island Express is a 1st class place to dine!"

            "text": "I was so excited to try this restaurant out given its many positive reviews. Unfortunately my experience was not a positive one and I will breakdown the rationale below:\n\nJerk chicken lunch special - This meal came in a small white container, one that usually holds dumplings to give you a perspective. Nonetheless, if the food was good, I would not have mind the small portion. The jerk chicken was by far the DRIEST jerk chicken I ever had. Not only were all the chicken white meat, which is fine, but it was extremely overcooked and rubbery. The best part of this lunch special was the plantains, which was cooked perfectly, soft and sweet. But unfortunately, the jerk chicken was not delicious at all...=/\n\nChicken stew with spinach and roti - You would think that a chicken stew would be moist, juicy, or at least tender. However, despite the sauce from the stew, the chicken was still incredibly dry. I was really looking forward to this dish for it sounded so delicious and heartwarming. Unfortunately, that was not my experience at all. Really wanted this first time experience to be amazing...\n\nOverall, the best part was probably the delivery person, who was nice and kind. If you do decide to give them a try, please try their other options because I'm sure they have some other more delicious selections! Just try to stay away from these two.\n\nThank you for reading and good luck!"
