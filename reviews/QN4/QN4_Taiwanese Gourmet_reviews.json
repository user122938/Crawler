We didn’t bother getting drinks since they serve fresh complimentary tea (we even got a refill!). I noticed almost every table ordered the clams, so I definitely felt like I was missing out. I’ll be coming back to try the seafood next time — especially those clams everyone seems to love."

            "text": "Note: This review is primarily for vegetarians who may find themselves dining here with meat-eating friends.\n\nTaiwanese Gourmet offers an authentic Taiwanese dining experience, and it’s best appreciated by those who eat meat. While there is a decent selection of about a dozen vegetarian dishes—mostly healthy, steamed tofu and vegetable options—they’re not the main attraction, lack depth in flavor and tend to be less exciting. That said, there are some more flavorful choices like crispy tofu and the traditional stinky tofu. The best vegetarian option is the crispy tofu with the savory garlic dipping sauce hands down! They are also accommodating and if you can describe something you’d like with their existing ingredients, they will try to accommodate.\n\nThe real draw of this place is its traditional Taiwanese entrees, which are clearly a hit—on weekends, every table is packed. It’s a lively, bustling atmosphere: expect a lot of noise, clanging pots, and fast-moving staff. Service is friendly but busy, and the overall vibe is more family-style chaos than quiet, relaxed dining. Also, they’re cash only, so come prepared."

From classic street snacks to more skillfully prepared dishes, you can find nearly all the Taiwanese favorites you might think of. The stir-fry dishes, in particular, are highly recommended—they’re full of wok hei and best enjoyed fresh on-site. With the fast service, it’s a good choice both for a quick solo meal and for casual gatherings with friends."

            "text": "I'm always searching for delicious Taiwanese food throughout NYC, so I was so excited to finally have the chance to stop by Taiwanese Gourmet recently. It's been bookmarked for quite a while, but it's a bit out of the way in Elmhurst where I don't find myself that often!\n\nOur party of 2 came by around 7pm on a weekday -- we were able to get seated immediately, and while the place was really busy the whole time we were there, I think there were always a couple of empty tables available.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes to share:\n\n- 蒼蠅頭 \"fly heads\" which is just stir-fried ground pork with chive flowers and black beans was not bad. I thought the ground pork had a great savoury flavour to it, but the chive flowers tasted a bit undercooked. I felt it was a bit heavy/oily, too.\n\n- 清炒高麗菜 sautéed cabbage was a little disappointing. Taiwanese cabbage is probably one of my favourite vegetables, and I was disappointed at how bland this dish was. The leaves were a bit too chewy for my taste, and I felt like it was significantly under-seasoned (salt/soy sauce/sesame oil would have gone a long way here).\n\n- 溼煎虱目魚 braised milk fish was delicious! It's not that common to find milkfish in the US (especially of this quality) even as a classic Taiwanese dish, so I was really pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was. The portion size was SO big, and the flesh was just soo fragrant -- tender, juicy, practically melted in your mouth with an amazing savouriness. Definitely would strong recommend this dish.\n\n- 番茄牛蓋飯 beef and tomato over rice was really tasty too. The tomato was cooked to a perfect softness, and the mature flavour paired really well with the slightly more umami bites of beef and scrambled egg in the thick sauce (some mix of black pepper and oyster sauce flavours). It was not too heavy at all when eaten with the rice; I felt like I could have just eaten this itself as my meal :)\n\nService was very quick, and all of the staff were very lovely with taking our order and offering suggestions and whatnot. Note that they are a cash only place, so do come prepared!\n\nWhile there were some spots for improvement, I think this was still a very yummy (and promising) meal overall, and I'm excited to come back to try some of their other dishes (on their quite expansive menu)."

The staffs and cooks are extremely discriminating and disgustingly rude and if you arent a tourist who has a camera out ready to post a video for them I advise you to avoid at all cost. I ordered a pork chop that was $15 They gave me all bones and fat and edges that were cut off and looks like a family of wolves got it before me it was greasy and disgusting. I told the owner herself about the situation then she told me to not question how her food looks when I clearly pointed that another table who was toursits got a way bigger portion and atleast looks edible and not looks like some dog bit out of it. Then she told me to never come back. I am also a asian and never had problems with takeout I came with my family once and this is how Im treated sick and disgusting."

We just took the peppers from the clam dish.\nPork chop over rice - didn't expect the pork to be on the sweet side.\nFood came out quickly. Service was attentive.\nCash only."

I couldn't put up with that kind of an attitude and left without waiting further. I understand that restaurants have their own rules but they have to make sense and be fair to their customers.
