We had coffee.\n\nFood was great bacon was not undercooked, which is something I struggle with at diners. sandwich was decently seasoned fries were fresh.\n\nOur server was great. He checked up on us enough to not be annoying, but also did not forget about us, which is a good balance.\n\nThere is a parking lot area, which obviously helps in Queens. I don’t know how many spots there are maybe 15 spots. There's outdoor seating as well with a cover so it’s not just in the sun.\n\nso far so good next time I go back I will try salad. Definitely recommend."

The outside area looked really nice, but we are inside. They make fresh muffins daily and I highly suggest getting a corn muffin. They grill it and it's so good - don't forget to take the wrapper off and definitely try it with grape jelly!"

The eggs were cooked as ordered, and the bacon was crisp. The potatoes were not as crispy as I requested, but they were fine.\n\nI will say that the staff was all over the place, and it looks like they do a steady take-out business, so the counter is not the move unless you want randoms hanging over your shoulder while someone packs a bag in front of you.\n\nI might add that at least one patron was confused about how a restaurant works.

When I lived here, I always went to Georgia Diner but after a not so great experience, we tried Buccaneer Diner and we were back the next day. Great service, great food, huge portions, and love the drinks and the corn muffin. The French toast was some of the best I’ve had even the bacon was perfect. I will ALWAYS come here for breakfast when in town and regret that I didn’t come here as a kid for the 16 years I lived in Elmhurst or any time I revisited. Athena was such a great server and my toddler son was in love with her."

We located this diner. When we  arrived The staff was very gracious. We was greeted and introduced to our waiter. By the name of Charlie. Charlie was exceptional, he was attentive. He was honest about the menu and very knowledgeable about all the items, and very courteous. Before we could order we were presented with some bread which was good. I ordered chicken Alfredo. I requested the chicken to be grilled. That was very good. Seasoned pretty good. I also ordered the chicken wings. I requested that they were cooked soft. They cook them perfect they were good as well slight spicy, but just right I use ranch dressing as a dipping sauce. then ordered the chicken soup. It was a chicken and rice soup. It was very very very good.  seasoned and full of  flavor. I also ordered a drink of sex on the beach. It was very good. I was feeling tipsy off of just that one drink. The manager came by twice and checked on me and my guests to make sure that we were OK and that the food was good and if we had any complaints. The price of the food was actually very affordable for quality food. Also the menu is very extensive there are so many choices to choice from for all occasions and time of the day. the location is in a great area the inside looked nice. Love the details overall this was a great experience. I cannot wait to come back to this area to go back and visit this location. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and commend them and their gracious staff on doing such a good job, especially to out of towners like myself."

Great variety of menu items and some of the Greek dishes (gyros, Greek Salad, etc.) are very noteworthy.
