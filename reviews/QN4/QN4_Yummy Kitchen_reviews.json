On the whole, my meal was edible yet underwhelming. My friend ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki with fried rice and two spring rolls. He loves teriyaki but  he's not a fan of their chicken and beef teriyaki. Being first-time patrons of The Yummy Kitchen, we felt blind-sided when the lady on the phone told me AFTER taking our food order that for FIRST-TIME customers they only accept cash or Apple Pay. This was not stated nor specified on their handout menu. On The Yummy Kitchen handout menu we'd received, it listed the credit cards that The Yummy Kitchen accepted: Visa, Mastercard, Discover. We were ready to pay for our meal with a credit card when the lady surprised me with the 'first-time customer/ cash/Apple Pay payment requirement'. We felt that was misleading and not in good faith. Needless to say, my friend and I will not be patronizing The Yummy Kitchen in the foreseeable future."

I got coconut shrimp and fries and they were delciious, 6 well fried coconut battered shrimp with tarter sauce and pretty crispy fries. My only gripe is I wish the fries were seasoned more with salt or the cajun seasoning by default.I gotta try the seafood boils next time. they got preset options and pick your own."
