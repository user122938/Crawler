I ended up ordering the white pudding, an eggball and a cheese roll. The server assured me that I wouldn’t be disappointed after I inquired about the taste. She definitely wasn’t lying. I felt like I was back home in Guyana.\n\nNo photos to post because the food disappeared before I could take a photo."
