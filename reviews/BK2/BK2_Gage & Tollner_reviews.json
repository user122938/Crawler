I love Salt ..this was ridiculous. The offered to make a new one but I was starving not have eaten since breakfast and then not having the soup. They took of 20% of the Price of the beef ...a gesture... Dessert Baked Alaska  Meringue was sickly sweet but had a beautiful silky texture.T he Mint was overpowering . Service was very good except one waiter went to clear my plate  ,Crossed over way to close to me , ruff table side manners.  A Surf n turf was served uncracked lobster w no tools to do so... ridiculous! Don't bother waisting your time , money ."

            "text": "What an amazing meal. We made a last minute decision to swing by here for dinner on Halloween and maybe check out the Sunken Harbor Club upstairs. Our original plan was drinks upstairs followed by dinner downstairs, but that quickly flipped around when we learned that there was a 90 minute wait for the nautical speakeasy. I'm glad our plans changed though as we were already fairly hungry, and after a few drinks upstairs, we wouldn't have savored every bite the way we did by eating first. About once or twice a year, we splurge and try caviar at various restaurants. This was among our absolute favorites. The blinis were soft, tasty and perfect sized. The creme that was served with it made a nice addition, but ultimately it all let the caviar be the star of the show (and it was). If you've never tried caviar before, this is the place to begin your journey. From there we got the she-crab soup and the roasted pumpkin soup along with the house rolls (these rolls are enough reason to come here - holy cow they were so good). Both soups hit the spot and it was tough to pick a favorite. Finally for our entree, we split the Beef Wellington for Two. I might rate this dish a hair below amazing, but still very good. The presentation was beautiful, the steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce hit all the right notes, but I feel like due to its size, the ratio of mushroom and pastry was miniscule compared to the steak. Again, still a very good meal, but might opt to try something else next time we dine here, and trust me, there will be a next time. The staff were outstanding. The crew that greeted us were fantastic in helping us get a table as well as help us organize with the hostess from upstairs to plan an amazing evening. Our server was wonderful and perfectly attentive. She even complemented us on our food choices, remarking that many of these are her favorites. The building itself is absolutely stunning. I had read about how both the interior and exterior are landmarked and I read a brief history of the restaurant on their website. It truly was a wonderful evening and I look forward to our next time dining here."

Everything was good but nothing truly blew us away.  Got the Ny strip, crab soup, rolls, dry aged pork chop, and hen of the woods mushrooms.\n\nThe baked alaska was incredible and the best part of the meal.\n\nI think steakhouses in general are very overpriced and not worth the time."

Aside from the oysters, our other favs include the hen of the woods mushrooms, she-crab soup, parker house rolls, and the shared porterhouse. If you're going for dinner, put your name in for the Sunken Harbor Club for a nightcap upstairs after your meal."

            "text": "The Best Post-Breakup Meal a Girl Could Ask For\nFive out of Five Stars (and I needed every single one of them)\nLet me start by saying: my emotional state when I walked into Gage & Tollner this past Sunday was... dramatic. I had just ended a \"Summer Fling\" (which, let's be honest, felt like a Shakespearean tragedy at the time, but now I mostly just want to laugh at myself). I needed an emotional outlet, and what better outlet than a full-on, glorious, celebratory seafood dinner?\nWell guess what ....they delivered a therapy session on a plate!\nFirst, the food: The Crab Soup was comforting, and exactly what a heartbroken (and now slightly embarrassed) woman needed. The Oysters Rockefeller tasted like a buttery, decadent hug. Seriously, I felt better with every slurp. And the Roasted Cauliflower? Perfection. Just the right amount of char to give it a great smokey kick.To wash it all down, I had a much-needed glass of Trousse-Chemise, Shea Vineyard. Let's just say, the vineyard was doing the Lord's work that night. But the real star of the show was the service. My spirits were lifted, not just by the food and the wine, but by the manager. He was incredibly friendly and I swear, he looked exactly like Snoop Dogg's more refined, hospitality-focused cousin. He noticed I was having a moment and told me I needed to smile. It sounds simple, but that little compliment completely brightened my day. It was the universe's way of saying, \"Honey, that summer guy was a footnote; now eat this delicious oyster and move on. So, to Gage & Tollner: Thank you for the incredible food, the good vibes, and for employing a manager who is a dead ringer for a hip-hop icon and an excellent compliment-giver. You turned my personal melodrama into a hilarious, delicious Sunday night story. You deserve every star!"

From the moment we walked in, the entire team exuded genuine warmth, respect, and professionalism. The smiles and the overall ambiance created a welcoming environment that is desperately needed in NYC and should be copied by other establishments.\n\nA special shout-out must go to our server, Lexy, who was utterly amazing and accommodating throughout the evening—we adored her! Manager Corbin was also exceptionally warm and went above and beyond to ensure our party had a perfect experience. He had the best smile and attentiveness.\n\nThe Food: A Culinary Journey\n\nThe care and skill in the kitchen match the front-of-house excellence.\n\nAppetizers: We started our culinary journey with several winners. The Parker Rolls were divine—perfectly warm and buttery. The mushrooms were earthy and impeccably seasoned, and the side salad was properly dressed and served incredibly fresh, offering a delightful crunch with every bite.\n\nEntrees: For the main course, the fried chicken was a standout: perfectly crispy and seasoned, served alongside whipped potatoes that were amazing. We loved the balance of textures and flavors in every dish we ordered.\n\nDesserts: The meal culminated in a 10 out of 10 finale. The rich and decadent chocolate layered cake was exceptional. Likewise, the sorbets, particularly the lemon and vanilla flavors, were bright, refreshing, and beyond perfect.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis establishment delivers an outstanding combination of world-class service and exceptional, thoughtful cuisine. It unequivocally deserves a ten out of ten. We absolutely cannot wait to return for another unforgettable meal."

            "text": "We chose this local restaurant to celebrate my son’s birthday because steak is his favorite, and we were hoping for something special. Unfortunately, I left regretting the choice.\n\nThe interior and decor were lovely—elegant and inviting—but the service felt robotic. There was no warm welcome or personable interaction. When you go to a nicer restaurant for a special occasion, you expect a more thoughtful and engaging experience. This felt no different from a run-of-the-mill spot.\n\nWe ordered the “steak for three,” but the portion felt more like it was for two. On top of that, we asked for medium, but what we got was definitely medium-well. The food wasn’t bad, but nothing stood out, and it certainly didn’t feel worth the price.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn’t recommend this place for a special occasion. It might be okay for a regular dinner, but if you’re celebrating something meaningful, I’d suggest looking elsewhere."

The Caesar salad and bread were great as always, but overall the food quality felt a step down from past visits… :("

Lucky made the most amazing drinks...the very best cucumber martini ever and guided us through the delicious menu. Can't say enough about the food as we tasted many things and watching Lucky make drinks was 100 % all the way. Make sure if in, around or passing through Brooklyn you try this amazing restaurant."

This historic Brooklyn steakhouse has been around since 1879, and it’s easy to see why it’s stood the test of time. The food is outstanding—classic surf & turf done right, with incredibly high-quality ingredients. I especially appreciate that their steaks are grass-fed, dry-aged, and many ingredients are sourced from local farms, which really shows in the flavor.\n\nThe service is warm and attentive, and the old-school atmosphere adds to the charm. It’s definitely on the pricier side, but well worth it for the quality and experience. My only minor complaint is that the tables are a little too close together, which can make it feel a bit tight. That said, we’ll absolutely be back—this place is a Brooklyn classic for a reason."

I’m delightfully satisfied.\n\nOne issue we had was with our steak — we ordered medium rare and it came more on the rare side. This is fine with me because I prefer my steak on the rare side, and the buttery texture and seasoning compensated. That being said, not all at my table preferred this.\n\nAll and all, I’m excited to eat here again sometime. Super modern and classy atmosphere, as well as great service. Every course was so unique from the last, and deeply satiating."

We weren’t exactly sure if the food was gonna be enough but our server Brandon gave us the perfect recommendation and we had just the right amount of food for everyone. The atmosphere and attention to details all the way to the marble bathroom to the brass faucets it was definitely worth a trip from Manhattan. Ask for Brandon and Sheikh Brandon knows how to provide a great experience and knows the menu very well.

It was rich with flavor and slight kick which is not common in most sauces. They also had a citrus dessert that was one of the best i have had in long time.

I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday but ultimately was left with a bad taste from this experience. Seriously overpriced for food that can be described only average at best.\n\nStarted with the Parker House Rolls which were nice and fluffy.\n\nFollowed by the seared foie gras (tiny slice - for $37?) and beef tartare which was ok but lacked seasoning.\n\nRibeye for 2 was the most disappointing of all. Clocking in at $163 we ordered it medium rare and it came rare on the inside and burnt to the point of being unpleasantly acrid on the palate on the outside. For this price, this should be a phenomenal, well-seasoned steak cooked perfectly, which it was not.\n\nSince the steak comes with no side dish, the server recommended the ‘hash brown’ which came out as 1 slice of the trendy layered potato dish that many restaurants are doing these days. I understand the immense work that goes into making a dish like that but for nearly $20, the portion was tiny.\n\nOn top of the food, we had 1 beer and 1 soft drink and the total bill was $345 for 2 people.\n\nThe last thing to mention is the staff knew it was my boyfriend’s birthday and since we didn’t want dessert as we were already disappointed with the food (and all I could taste was burnt steak), the server did something very strange and put a candle on the metal tray when delivering the bill?! That’s a first for me. Awkwardly prompting someone to blow out a birthday candle on the bill was just a bit uncomfortable.\n\nI really wanted to like Gage and Tollner but sad to say this, his birthday wish was probably ‘I wish we’d gone somewhere else’…."

We had a number of items that I didn’t get a chance to take a photo of, including the Crispy Hen-Of-The-Woods Mushrooms, the wedge salad, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Great steakhouse that offers more than steak. Thank you G&T for a great first visit."

The service is very professional and the atmosphere is def bringing back you to the old days! The staff also put our names down for the bar upstairs when we arrived (of course we asked first). Once we finished the meal, our seats upstairs opened up so perfect timing! Almost forgot to mention the unique and delicious fresh mint ice cream as dessert!"

Loved the decor.\n\nThe service was great, our server made great recommendations for questions we had. Even let us know about happy hour which was on the weekend (we came Saturday).\n\nLoved my food and drinks. I had the restaurant week menu with a sweet potato soup, a choice of burger or turkey burger, and a peanut butter caramel ice cream. All of it was great. My friend is already saying she will def come back!"

The NY Strip steak I got here was one of the best pieces of meats I’ve ever had and and served with plenty of baked garlic and a potato side reminiscent of a gratin dauphinois (I’m French yes). This is completed by the coolest and most extensive dry martini menu I’ve ever seen, with variants I didn’t even know. They offer a happy hour on those and oysters. And to finish, add a historic background making you feel like you’re in a Scorsese movie or Mad Men, in this lovely area of Downtown Brooklyn. One for the books."

She was phenomenal, so nice, so knowledgeable about the menu, and really made us feel welcomed. We were celebrating our anniversary so we were offered some bubbly to cheers to. The food was delicious. We ordered a lot - half a dozen of oysters, Parker rolls, a clam appetizer special with miso, chicken live pate, wedge salad, a T-bone steak with a side of mashed potatoes and onion rings, and mint ice cream and coconut sorbet for dessert.\n\nI couldn’t stop raving on about the chicken liver pate, it was incredible. I requested extra toast because it was a very generous portion.\n\nThe tbone steak was ordered medium well, but it was more on a medium rare temperature side. We were asked how it was cooked but we aren’t ones to send food back so we said it was perfect. It was a little chewy, but the taste was very good so we were happy enough with it.\n\nThe mint ice cream was so fresh, it literally was like mint leaves, it was so nice to end the dinner off.\n\nAfter dinner, we were interested in having a few drinks in the sunken harbor club, and Morgan was so nice to check on the availability with the hosts for seating, and the cocktails up there were delicious!"

We recently enjoyed a fantastic meal here, indulging in their classic veal for two with hashed browns, perfectly cooked fried chicken, and flavorful bass with risotto. The meal started with an appetizer of salad wedges and delectable mushrooms, and the bread was simply divine. Their wine selection is excellent, and we finished the night off with a slice of their unforgettable Alaskan cake. Overall, Gage and Tollner is a must-try for anyone seeking a memorable fine dining experience in Brooklyn. It was my 1000th restaurant in New York: where else to celebrate? It was an unforgettable experience!"

It'd be great if they were able to expand, given their comeback, the attraction of Sunken Harbor and the neighboring construction.\n\nAs usual, we began with a dozen oysters, two blue crab soups, and tge Parker rolls. Delicious! 😋 The first time I brought hubby to G&T, he had an amazing grilled blue bass. It was hard to get him to share with me. 😆  Unfortunately, that was not available this visit, so given the unusual price for the grilled porgy, he settled for the tilefish (cause he does not eat red meat), but truth, while handsome in presentation, it should have been a larger piece of fish. Anteways. . . . I had the NY strip, medium well with fries.  Our dinner was complimented by two old fashioned for me and a non-alcoholic spritzer for him.  Our server, Teddy, was cool. A tall dude who needs to squat down to your table to take your order, 😆 cool dude.\n\nWe opted out of dessert but did have a nice time."

            "text": "Recent visit indicated a decline in the restaurant. The Parker house rolls were actually not very tasty, and were served before the oysters, so they sat there for a while.  Dishes were good but not amazing like the first time.  The pot pie was all crust and very little substance. Seared foie gras not as good. The hen of the woods mushroom dish was very tasty though. Felt a bit overpriced, although there’s happy hour options before 6.\n\nFrom a year ago:  Wow.  Wish I could give it six stars.  Lives up to the hype. Best restaurant in Brooklyn.  After an extraordinarily nice greeting from the maitre d’ team we were led upstairs to the speakeasy for a drink, with its fabulous deep sea decor we felt transported - and then to the downstairs bar for an incredible dinner, amazing snails, a huge wedge salad, Korean-inspired friend chicken (with kale and kimchi slaw), incredible hash browns, and second-only-to/Daniel seared foie gras. The baked Alaska was a slight disappointment compared to the one we had at Figaro but was still excellent and the meringue just so decadent. Service was fabulous, our foie gras initially came out cold but they replaced it. Same with a bad wine bottle. The room made us feel like we were in Vienna.  Dining in Brooklyn is always more friendly than Manhattan. It’s just better.  Best restaurant in best borough.  Definitely go."

            "text": "I hear G & T is the favorite NYC restaurant of a certain pop superstar, but considering I find both her and this place to be bland, vanilla and forgettable, I guess that shouldn't surprise me.\n\nOur best dish was served first: a trio of scrumptious, unique pastries all done to perfection. Kudos to Caroline Schiff for introducing the world to a Kelp and Kimchi Scone (mmm). The Rainbow Carrot Goat Cheese Danish, and Pistachio and Chocolate Snail, were no losers either. So if you're going to have your keto cheat day, this is the place to have it.\n\nHowever, everything after that was a slow descent into mediocrity. Our Crispy Hen-Of-The Woods Mushrooms were great, especially with the accompanying sriracha sauce. The Dry-Aged Beef Tartare, on the other hand, was pretty tasteless. The mushrooms accompanying the Sunflower & Field Bean Risotto were great (I think these guys are just good with shrooms), but the risotto itself was undercooked and under-seasoned.\n\nThe Golden Bread Brûlée was fine but tasted like generic bread pudding for all the fancy ingredients listed with it. And our dessert splurge of Coconut Layer Cake was also fine but forgettable. They could've done so much more with the kumquat than just use it as a garnish.\n\nUnless you reeeeally need alcohol, I'd skip the brunch cocktails that range from $18-20. Our Claret Punch just tasted like watered down sangria without any of the fruit joy.\n\nPretty spot, but NYC is loaded with these kinds of old-school American restaurants with rich mahogany walls and brass accents."

We came in for dinner on Thursday night with another couple, all of us first timers at G&T. The place was PACKED! which speaks volumes about the popularity of this fine establishment. Our meal was well-paced, at times a little bit rushed as the servers were attempting to collect plates before all of us were finished. The stand-out of the meal was the Baked Alaska - I would return here just for that!!! and believe you wouldn't find a better version of it anywhere in NYC. My entire meal, from start to finish, was a solid 4 - see photos of the dishes we tried. The menu has a nice variety of old-timey dishes to choose from. And since the descriptions are not overly detailed, you will do well engaging your server for recommendations."

The menu is long with many options for any type of diner or mood.

It is titled as a dessert for two but it’s so big we couldn’t even finish it although we tried.\nThis is definitely a “special occasion” type of place, mainly due to the price and the calories it entails, but what a great time it is."

Unfortunately it was good but not worth the price or effort to visit.\n\nThe chicken is fried with some gritty mix so it comes out crunchy but the real problem was the chicken was just too dry. Considering I was served dark meat, this was a bad sign.\n\nI also had the Caesars salad, which was good but not special. Instead of crotons they have a flat cracker that can be broken up. It looks good for the photos but doesn't taste great.\n\nThe one dish I liked was the she-crab soup. Rich, creamy and with nice chunks of crab, this is a winner.\n\nOverall while it wasn't bad, it wasn't good enough to revisit."
