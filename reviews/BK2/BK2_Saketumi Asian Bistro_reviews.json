It looks like they were rushing me, even though I got there at 9pm.\nI feel that the waitress thought I was not “financially appropriate “ to be in that area because I was not groomed, basically using shorts and a t-shirt.\nBrooklyn Heights is a tourist spot, people go there to see the sunset, walk around Dumbo, cross the bridge… if you open a restaurant there and your staff pre judge you for your clothes or your accent (I’m latina) then this is not your place.\nNot mentioning that I order soup and she gave me salad, and the worst part was when she checked if I tipped her in front of me.\n\nDon’t bother yourself going in person, ask for delivery lol"

Quite chewy and not what expected.\nSpicy sashimi appetizer was good (but not spicy) and came in the form of tuna and salmon stripes wrapped around smth looking like a tuna tartar. Inventive and not bad at all, but description was quite deceiving.\nSeaweed salad on the contrary was spicier than usually in other places.\nMackerel sashimi was ok.\nPineapple fried rice with chicken was the only thing we really loved, lots of pineapple and chicken, very flavorful.\nIt was our 1st time ordering from this place so we enjoyed 10% off.

I knew I had found a gem as it was packed throughout my whole meal. They’ve got an extensive lunch specials menu I’ve got to see! I highly recommend calling ahead for a table, especially if you come during their lunch or dinner rush. Service was excellent from walking through the door until I left. I started with their Amuse-bouche, which was an excellent pickled serving. Next came a Manhattan roll—sorry, I failed as I forgot to snap a picture. This was unique and very tasty. I really enjoyed the seaweed on the outside for the texture it gave as it seemed thicker and wider than most seaweed I’ve had. This was quickly followed with my bowl of miso soup. This was the weakest part of the meal as it was lacking a depth of flavor, but I added a bit of wasabi from my roll plate and that really helped. My main course was the lunch special, Yaki Udon with shrimp. This was a large portion for the price and super tasty with veggies, noodles, a sauce, and shrimp."

They helped her up and apologized profusely. They also provided warm sanitizer wipes and water almost immediately. Then hit tea at my wife's request.\n\nMy friend ordered the Spicy Mango Shrimp because the ladies next to us ordered it and we were intrigued by both its presentation and smell.\n\nI ordered the Brooklyn Roll and a side of the BBQ Squid.
