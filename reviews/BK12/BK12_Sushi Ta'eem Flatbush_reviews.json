Walking in automatically you notice great decor and we were seated immediately, and had water a plates brought to us in a matter of seconds. Menu looked great and they have many options. We got a few different rolls and all of them were amazing best kosher sushi in queens and Brooklyn the bills didn’t break my wallet. Very happy with eating here."

The service was great. There came in lots of young people at about 11:30, the restaurant was filled in to the last table, and servers and cooks were working fast and well organized.  All those kids left at the same time just as they came in, must be school nearby.  It became quiet again. Workers sprayed and wiped all tables and each chair after they left. The bottom line is good food , a clean and pleasant place with great service."

The menu is very simple so you don't get confused while ordering food and still the have a great menu. 3. The service was quick and very nice. This is the place to go enjoy a family night out and have great food (Sushi) and even the dessert they have only 2 choices so we ordered both and as expected the were awesome!!!!\nAnd not to forget the music playing there was as great as everything else!!!\nWould recommend highly this place!!!\nOh and I almost forgot the pricing is decent too like I said best place ever!!\nJust a little add on: If you find a dish not satisfactory to you they are quick to either compensate you or take it off the bill. All with a smile and a sincere apology. I saw a review that complained about the music personally I'm a big fan of it. Being Israeli and really missing home I always enjoy the Israeli music in the background. Please don't ever change it!"

I would write those thoughts but it would be a waste  of your time to read about a roll that you can’t even put a name too.\n\nBut yes once again service unbelievable so quick and delicious.\n\nGreat spot!!!!!\n\nOriginal review: I ordered a small platter they said 15 minutes I came back in 13 min and it was ready and let me tell ya this was in a Saturday night!!!\n\nPretty impressive eh!!\n\nPrior to coming into the store i felt like I was gonna die so I told the women behind the counter btw I feel like I’m going to die.\n\nYou know what she responded!\nwe don’t have insurance so if you gonna die please go outside.\n\nNow that’s the type of service I like, to the point and blunt.\n\nJust really great service…."
