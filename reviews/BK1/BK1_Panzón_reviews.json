            "text": "Extremely Disappointing Experience and Lack of Accountability:\nOn October 24th my husband and I had an unfortunate incident at this restaurant. Our server accidentally dropped a plate with three different dressings, which splattered all over us - our clothes, shoes, my scarf, and my bag. Accidents happen, and we were initially understanding. The server apologized and said the restaurant would reimburse the cost of our dinner, but that promise was never fulfilled.\nThe next day, I went back to speak with the manager, but was told he wasn’t there. I left my phone number and was told he would call me later. A few hours later, the hostess called to say that the manager was unwell and would return on Wednesday,  but I never received a call. I sent three emails directly to the manager with no response. I also contacted the restaurant’s general email address, and while someone replied saying the owner was overseas and would get back to me, I never heard back despite sending three follow-up emails.\nThis was a severe incident that caused significant inconvenience and damage, my brand-new shirt was completely ruined, and we had to take several items to the dry cleaners. We even had to cancel our evening plans and return to our hotel to change.\nWhat’s most disappointing is not the accident itself, but the complete lack of responsibility and communication afterward. I expected at least a sincere apology or some follow-up from management, but received neither.\nI truly hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously and improves its approach to customer care and accountability."

Brunch with girlfriends, a cocktail on a weeknight with my fiancée, Friday night when they have a DJ, or taking my parents out to dinner - Panzon is perfect for every occasion! The staff is so friendly and very attentive. The Panzon cocktail is sooo delicious, and I’ve tried nearly every food item on the menu. The sticky wings are hands down the best, tuna tostada and mushroom quesadilla are two of my other favorites, but you really can’t go wrong!! Can’t wait to go back soon!\n\nNew Review 11/2/2025\nWe hosted our Welcome Party at Panzon and it was amazing!!! The planning process was incredibly easy and they were such easy people to work. We opted to have an open bar and it did not disappoint! The staff was incredible and the service was so fast. We did platters of different tacos, chips and guac, and mini tuna tostadas. The tuna tostadas were so delicious and a crowd favorite! We bought out the whole restaurant and our guests loved mingling in the space but also spreading into the backyard for some breathing room. We wanted to have a few speeches and the owners were so kind as to buy a microphone that would hook into their sound system. Everyone went above and beyond and next thing you know, our guests made a dance floor! 100/10 would recommend for an event, or even just dinner in Greenpoint! Love this place so much and can’t wait to go back soon!"

For $20, it included chips and guac or salsa—not bad at all. The margarita was delicious, and the chips were fresh.\n\nOnce my friends arrived, we ordered a few dishes to share: the enchiladas, tacos a la barbacoa, and tres leches cake. Everything was good, though the food itself wasn’t something we’d rave about, but we definitely enjoyed the overall vibe.

Dismantled bloomin fried onion shreds with some kind of southwestern ranch thing from the gods. Perhaps the best menu offering is the “your way” Margarita.
