This has to be the best sandwich I’ve ever had. Bahn mi used to be my favorite but this beats it. Add the Ajvar sauce and it’s even more great. I would recommend this place to everyone"

I loved the shredded feta on the salad I’ve never seen that before and it gave a unique touch to the salad and inspired me to love feta even more than I already did. Overall this was a great meal and worth a try especially if you’ve never had Albanian food before."

Though they have no breakfast menu in their menu they made it for me when I asked whether they have it. It was delicious!! I swear it is just perfect! If you like stuff with meat and not vegan go there, you will enjoy it and thank you guys! I am your regular! I am ready to go to see you for breakfast lunch and dinner. I guess it is family business? Just wonder because I see that you really love your job!🙏🙏🙏\n\nUpdates. Review in 2024.\nI’ve been coming to this place a lot but unfortunately I could see how quality of food went down. Especially “borek pie”. It was full of meat inside first when I came here. But today I just realized there’s almost no meat inside. It is not a borek pie anymore, it is a pie with some drops of ground meat inside. Literally 2-3 times less than it is used to do. But the worst part is before it was $22, and now $26. That’s not fair guys…"

Arberia Grill is a hidden gem that prioritizes quality and customer care. I can't wait to return and try more of their offerings! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience."

Service was top notch, and the food was so good that we ate it right away and forgot to take pictures.\n\nWe had the mixed grill platter, cheese burek, meat burek, qofte sharri (seasoned ground veal grilled stuffed with cheddar cheese), peppers and cream. Dessert we had tres leches and bombica.\n\nOur waitress was very kind and attentive. Overall an amazing experience. If you’re looking to try Albanian cuisine, this is the place!!"

Thank you for introducing your cuisine on a such a high level!\nThe only one issue about this place is that they don't have any system to eliminate smoke from cooking, frying etc. Guys, you need to fix this, so customers would not sit in the smoke. I'll still leave 5 starts hoping you'll improve that soon."
