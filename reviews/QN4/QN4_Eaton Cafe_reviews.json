It was so salty that I couldn’t finish it after a few bites and even tried mixing it with some boiled vegetables at home, but it was still overpowering. I truly appreciate the warm service and overall experience; I just hope the salt level can be adjusted next time because the actual flavor was very well developed."

The menu is huge with so many great options to choose from.\n\nI started with the pork soup dumplings — they were amazing, perfectly flavored and delicate. The popcorn shrimp leaned a little sour for my taste, but still enjoyable. The pork bun was another highlight: soft bun, fresh veggies, and great balance overall.\n\nFor entrees, we tried the Volcano Tonkatsu and the dry ramen with chicken. Both were excellent — the tonkatsu had a rich, flavorful broth, and the dry ramen was just as satisfying.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this spot and encourage supporting this wonderful small business in the neighborhood!"

We got the tonkatsu ramen and chicken karaage \"tsukemen\". Decent portion size. I really like that the ramen soup wasn't very salty. The chicken karaage was the best out of everything I ate. I didn't get the dessert b.c the cakes looked old. The bakery goods on the other hand, I'll be back to try that.\n\nI took off a star because the menu said tsukemen, which is dipping noodles, but they actually meant mazesoba or abura soba---dry ramen (no soup). I suggest changing the menu b.c it's misleading. Also, the thai tea was not good. It was overly sweet and tasted like canned thai tea or heavily watered down. Air circulation needs a bit work; felt like the oil was stuck to the air. Other than mentioned, it's a decent spot to eat at. The restaurant was clean and spacious. Service was nice; the waitresses were attentive.\n\nTotal for dinner was a little over $36 for two orders and a drink after tax and tips. They have happy hours from 4pm to 6pm, I think. And there's a promo going on: buy one main dish, get the second 30% off. Not sure when that's over."

The galanga chicken was also tasty albeit a little dry - I didn't mind it though as the paired sauce made up for it and was delicious. We got a matcha crepe cake for dessert and it tastes good but the texture isn't as expected for a crepe cake - the layers were very thick. The top layer was also harder and dried out possibly from being open to the air inside the display case? I would still come back here to eat again as the food tastes good and the staff are super friendly. The cafe also plays music at a nice volume so that it's not too loud. I didn't get a chance to try their pastries but they are nearly arranged and look good! Overall, Eaton is a welcome addition to the neighborhood."

Ramen was a bit lackluster, marinated egg and chashu was cold, and the noodles were a bit on the sticky-chewy texture side of things, but otherwise, not bad. Takoyaki was ok too, got plenty of octopus in there. Got good stuff, but I might wanna try something else here..."

So there is no space for desserts 😂 we might try their ice cream next time.5\nthey are now serving dimsum, we tried the pork shumai and the shrimp shumai, both were delicious, the soy sauce that came with it was on the sweeter side, would love for it to be on the salty side or plain soy sauce would be nice too. But all in all great experience! We’ll be coming back! We’ve been here 4 times since it opened. Thank you Eaton!"
