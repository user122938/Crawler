Half the size of a regular hot dog.\n\nAdded: I did NOT receive any pickles or cole slaw with my lobster roll like you mentioned in your reply.  Came with maybe 10 fries. We came when you just opened up. We were the only ones in there. The person at the register spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out how to use the register to \"ring us up\"\n\nThis is my first time there and this is my honest review."

We played it simple just in case and ordered fish & chips and a combo seafood plate with fried whiting, calamari and shrimp w/ fries. No regrets!! But next time we’ll be exploring the menu a little more. Soooooo good. Fresh. Well seasoned. Perfectly fried. And the sauces were amazing too!!!

It was rainy so we opted to sit inside. Might only be about 10-15seats? The menu was a bit over whelming and there were fresh fish and live lobsters. We decided on fish and chips, mussels and fried shrimp bc we were no sure how to order the fish. Everything was absolutely amazing! Pleasantly surprised and the owner Mohammed was so friendly and accommodating. The mussels were cooked perfectly and we even got  bread to dip in the sauce. The shrimp was also delicious with thick cut fries. ( don’t forget the tartar sauce)  Next time we go we’ll be more adventurous and try the fresh fish. Upon leaving  Mohammad even gave us some treats. Will definitely be back."

The snapper sandwich was not my speed of fish, but it was still absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe how tasty it was. The whiting was off the charts that's my go-to fish and they didn't disappoint. And lastly, but surely not least the calamari was great hot and once it cooled down. I tried the salt and vinegar fries them thangs were a different kind of good, and the coleslaw slaw was on point. They also have fresh squeezed juices, and they were also great in freshness as well as taste. The staff is amazing, very friendly. When I told them I came from Long Island, they made sure to point me in the direction of the restroom, which I very much needed. Most places don't like customers using their restroom. I will definitely be coming back here. To try their very opinion filled menu."

Her customer service was BEYOND and she made sure to have everything we needed on our table without us asking a thing.\n\nThe location was clean and easy to navigate. We sat outside in the back and it was super cute and cozy.\n\nTHE FOOD THOUGH??? My Goodness was the food good. We had one of the Boils with lobster, snow crab, shrimp, corn and a side of Rockefeller Oysters. The seasoning was rich and seeped all through the food,  everything was fresh and the quantity of food was just right for two people. Even the white rice was moist. I could have eaten that by itself!\n\nEnd of story. We WILL be back. Thank you Bay Ridge Fish Market for a great experience and some great food."

He got there around 7:15 pm and even though the food was not ready until almost 9, he said the staff was upfront about the wait and offered him a salad and drinks on the house to make him comfortable. When I called earlier to check if they had seafood boils, they were just as kind and honest on the phone.\n\nWe live near Brooklyn College and the moment he walked through the door, the aroma of fresh seafood took over the house. He brought back a full spread: lobster roll, shrimp linguine, lobster mac and cheese, and of course my seafood boil. He works remote so he is all set for tomorrow and Tuesday The shrimp were cleaned on both sides which I truly appreciate. The butter sauce was flavorful and the best part is nothing was salty. The corn was grilled which added an extra layer of flavor. I fully expected the lobster tail to be overcooked because that tends to happen in boils but it was actually perfect. Sometimes when you get cooked seafood to go and it’s not as hot anymore, it can lose some of the flavor but this didn’t.\n\nThe food hits and I am grateful for both the service and my husband’s patience. Great customer care really makes all the difference. I will definitely be heading over there myself next time. This was a perfect way to end the weekend."

These succulent delights were so delicious they practically melted in my mouth, leaving me craving more with every bite.\n\nBut the culinary magic didn't stop there. The baked clams were a revelation, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Each clam was a bite of oceanic bliss. And let's not forget the fish tacos, which were an explosion of flavors wrapped in a soft tortilla. Even though I don’t really like fish tacos. Simply put, they were some of the best I've ever tasted.\n\nI wish I could share more photos of this incredible feast, but the food was so irresistibly delicious that I couldn't pause to capture it all. Bay Ridge Fish Market is a must-visit for any seafood lover, offering a dining experience that tantalizes every taste bud. Highly recommend!"

They added some edamame beans to the salad after hearing I loved them. Now that’s great service 😁 Everything was fresh, delicious and surprisingly affordable! There’s a lovely garden in the back for diners to enjoy. The owner told me they are hoping to make some enhancements so diners can enjoy the garden space during the winter months as well. They are also in the process of diversifying their menu offerings by adding plant-based dishes for non-meat eaters! I was so thrilled to hear that. Its always wonderful to have options, so thank you Fishbar for striving to create a menu that appeals to multiple culinary palates!"

The quality of the seafood here is amazing & so fresh! Purchase salmon and you won’t be disappointed I promise. They also offer poke bowls and a selection of tasty grab and go items like shrimp and bacon macaroni & cheese, baked clams, shrimp cocktail, and other put together meals. What really makes them wonderful though is the fact that in addition to a seafood market, they’re also a small restaurant with shaded outdoor seating offering classics like fish & chips and lobster rolls which they will quickly cook up for you. Truly the best fish and chips I’ve had in Brooklyn and all their pricing I’d incredibly fair for the quality. I couldn’t recommend them more!"

            "text": "Right as you walk in there’s fresh seafood waiting for you. I was greeted immediately  with a friendly face. Because I follow them on Instagram I ordered their special they highlighted for that Sunday: a shrimp burrito. Hubs got the lobster roll and we grabbed a seat outside in the back. We regretted the decision only because it was colder than we thought and my sweater was not doing its job. My guy kept us updated on our food and apologized for the wait but it was so understandable cuz there was a cute (birthday?) party and the kitchen was hustling to get their orders in. It’s a small-ish space; party table in the back for about 6, table in front for 2, bar stools by the register for 4, and outdoor seating could be for about 10. But when we wanted to move, they made sure to clear the table and have it ready. Service is so attentive and kind that it felt rare.\nOkay, the FOOD: that lobster roll was at capacity and the fries were perfect. The shrimp burrito had shrimp in nearly every bite. The size was enough where I could finish but also feel stuffed but also could walk. We couldn’t stop there. We had to take home some appetizers that they have prepared in the fridge. While their homemade hummus looked gorgeous, we opted for mac and cheese and the crab empanadas. I also had some pieces of salmon broiled. All this seafood and a couple of drinks came out to be under $100. I’ll definitely be back!"

Crab cheese sticks elevated by real crabmeat - so tasty. Will order again and even better make a trip to their restaurant."

            "text": "We went on Christmas Eve, service is warm and friendly on the phone and in person. Moe gave us free shrimp rice balls as an appetizer. My lobster fra diavlo was delicious and a generous portion. The lobster was tender and sweet, the sauce just the right spiciness. The only criticism I can come up with is, that the menu listed clams and mussels in my dish and there weren’t any. Still it was more than I could finish in one sitting and I took some home. My son had a poke bowl, he enjoyed ordering unlimited toppings. I recommend this fresh seafood place.I suspect that the cooked entrees may be preferable to the sushi, I usually only get sushi at sushi restaurants"

It was delicious. Freshly fried served with tomato sauce and lemon wedges.  A must try.\nNext we clam chowder soup.  Very very good. Finally we shared a shrimp Bo boy sandwich.  The shrimp were gigantic and perfectly fried.\nConsidering the quality, the prices are very good.\nWe will be back!!"
