            "text": "If you're looking for truly authentic Thai cuisine, éléphant district is an absolute gem. The atmosphere feels more like a lively canteen than a styled restaurant — and that’s exactly what makes it so real. It instantly brought me back to my days in Thailand: the simplicity, the energy, the feeling of everyday life and everyday food done beautifully.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, Peter welcomed us with genuine warmth, making us feel right at home. And a special thank you to Kay, who took attentive and thoughtful care of us throughout the meal. She was friendly, present, and knowledgeable without ever overwhelming the experience.\n\nThe food itself is outstanding — bold, fresh, and deeply flavorful. Every dish tastes like it’s made with care and authenticity, not adjusted or toned down. And it’s always a good sign when many Thai guests choose to eat there too — it says a lot about how true the flavors are.\n\nI’ve enjoyed Thai food in many different places, and this is truly among the most memorable experiences. If you’re craving genuine Thai flavors and an atmosphere that transports you right back to Thailand, this place is a must. We will absolutely be returning."

I ordered the crab fried rice and the bangkok fried wings, everything was super delicious. & the waitress Vicky helped us with picking our entree. She was a great hostess ! We sat outside and it was a nice ambience, dog friendly with the outdoor seating. Ordered the elephant drink but it doesn’t come in the glass if you sit outside so just be mindful of that and I recommend ordering with less ice. But other than that this place is a 4.5/5"

From the moment we sat down, she was warm, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, offering recommendations that turned out to be excellent.\n\nCity had a great sense of timing—she checked in just enough to make sure we had everything we needed without ever feeling rushed. She anticipated small things before we asked and made the whole dining experience feel easy and enjoyable, especially, with water. That level of care and attention to detail really makes a difference.\n\nOverall, Elephant District delivered on both food and service, and City went above and beyond to make it special. I’ll definitely be coming back and recommending it to friends."

Get a reservation or come early.\n\nEach dish is so tasty!  Genuinely, I'm not certain you could go wrong with any of their dishes because every one we had was delicious, presented well, and fun.\n\nOverall, this is a lovely restaurant with a fun vibe, a cute bar, a larger dining area inside, and outdoor seating.

The food is bold, fresh, and full of authentic flavor but what truly sealed the deal for us was the unforgettable mango sticky rice.\n\nThe mango was perfectly ripe and fragrant, paired with soft, slightly chewy sticky rice and that rich, velvety coconut cream that hits all the right notes! It’s the kind of dessert that makes you close your eyes and savor every bite. Easily one of the best mango sticky rice dishes we’ve had in the city.\n\nThe entire experience was made even better thanks to Peter and Sity, who took such great care of us. They were warm, attentive, and made us feel right at home from the moment we sat down. Their genuine hospitality really elevated the whole meal.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Thai spot in NYC that serves both incredible food and heartfelt service, this is it. Don’t leave without trying the mango sticky rice and definitely ask for Peter and Sity. 💕💕"

Maybe I had too much expectation. Also I felt it was a little overpriced for what you get (portions were a little small).\n\nNice location with an interesting interior with a lot of AI generated images (and even on their printed menu where a person had 6 fingers lol)."

I got the Wan Thong (which is like a lychee martini) which has butterfly pea flower 😍. My friend got the Lao Thong which he also enjoyed! Definitely come and check them out! Totally worth it!"

It is located in a great spot in Dumbo as well. I enjoyed the chicken pad Thai and a Thai tea, and both were amazing. We also enjoyed a homemade mango dessert, which was absolutely delicious! Overall, I would recommend Elephant District to anyone looking for some good Thai food in Brooklyn."

We ordered the Bangkok Night Market Wings, Lobster Pad Thai, Kana Moo Krob (with the fried egg), Khao Pad Pu, Pad Kee-Mao with beef, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Iced Tea.\nThe food was phenomenal! The wings were crispy and cooked to perfection. The presentation of the Lobster Pad Thai was incredible (just look at the photo),The Pad Thai was saucy with a huge whole lobster on top. The Kana Moo Krob was a succulent pork belly dish in a sauce we would have drank with a straw. The crab meat fried rice (Khao Pad Pu) was full of sweet crab and very filling. The Pad Kee-Mao was a great spicy noodle dish, with an addictive heat. Despite being full, we couldn’t leave without sampling the mango sticky rice (and a Thai iced tea) and we’re glad we did because it was the icing on top of a great meal.\nOverall the impeccable service (hi, Kay!), amazing food, and reasonable prices will have us trekking back across the bridge from the Bronx to visit again."

            "text": "This is a hard review to write. Love Thai food and was excited to order from this place given the glowing reviews, but the experience was incredibly underwhelming. It’s possible that the takeout (delivery) experience is completely different from the in-person dining experience, so I put that forth as a disclaimer.\n\nOrdered two Thai iced teas and a duck pad Thai (around 6:30pm) and the food took a little over an hour to be prepared and wasn’t delivered until a little after 8pm. On arrival, it was clear that one of the Thai iced teas wasn’t sealed well and leaked into the bag. Meanwhile, the pad Thai, being cold aside, had a sad portion of (dried) duck — very different from how it’s displayed.\n\nVery disappointing and hope that the team takes an opportunity to improve their delivery service going forward."

Highly recommend the steamed/ baked fish in banana leaf, Hormok Pla. They had a very nice mango Thai iced tea too, although it may be seasonal. We also had a very well prepared mock duck Thai basil fried rice. It is a good Thai place for vegetarians. Being right next to Dumbo, it is conveniently situated for dining after a sunset walk along the waters."
