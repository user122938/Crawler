One of the men’s nails and fingers were so dirty. This is also not the first time either. He also cooks sometimes. This is a major food distribution issue. Customers deserve basic hygienic practices for the support they give."

            "text": "my experience at Yard and Abroad Bistro in Brooklyn tonight (around 7:50pm) was disappointing.\n\nFirst off, the gentleman serving me seemed like he didn’t want to be there—sucking his teeth and giving off an attitude when I asked about the seafood soup. I ordered the large seafood soup, expecting a decent portion. Instead, I literally watched him put one shrimp, a tiny crab leg, and then fill the rest with dumplings and potatoes. Hardly any seafood at all.\n\nWhen I politely decided to order something else, his attitude got even worse. For a place calling itself a bistro, I expected way more professionalism and hospitality. Honestly, it felt like I was bothering them just by ordering.\n\nDefinitely not the type of experience that makes you want to come ..and I will not be back"
