Standouts for me were the potato mille-feuille (the sauce was one of the highlights of the night) and the Hokkaido somen (the dish I wish I didn't have to share).\n\nWe split two desserts - the panna cotta and banana sundae. That sundae was mind-blowingly good.  There was no reason that it should be that good, but it was unanimously our favorite.\n\nService was outstanding and the restaurant was understated and lovely."

Came because of the good reviews but the food was just not good.\n\nWe got the duck confit sandwich for $41 which was fine, the beef pie which was okay, but the worst part was the fries. Walked by the kitchen and see a huge bag of frozen fries just being used for the dishes and they tasted terrible.\n\nDrinks we're good and the service was good too but food was a total miss."

The restaurant, including the bathroom, was very clean and well-maintained.\n\nWe ordered the Japanese breakfast set and the apple tart tatin pancakes. The short rib in the breakfast set was a highlight — beautifully cooked, juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The tomato soup, however, was a bit too salty for our taste.\n\nThe pancakes were light and fluffy, which I really enjoyed. However, I wasn’t a fan of the apple and miso caramel topping. The apple lacked flavor, and the miso caramel had a bitter note that didn’t quite work for me."

So refreshing and full of amazing seafood flavor without being extremely strong or pungent.\n2. Niku short rib jaga - meat was perfectly cooked and combined perfectly with the dashi flavor.\n3. Lingo Beef pie - very hearty and aromatic. Delicious but did not stand out other than it's presentation. Probably the most American-inspired of all their dishes.\n\nAlso the cocktails were hitting the spot. Would for sure come here again."

            "text": "wanted to try lingo for so long. milk bread was awesome, less like a milk bread & more like a pudding-y challah. (fantastic.) beef pie, with a curry interior, missed the mark on including potatoes & carrots, characteristic of both pot pie & curry. we heard lots about this item and flocked to try it. the gravy was a little thin & so we think a solution could be more items in the interior. also a bottom crust as opposed to only a top crust would be a great touch. the short rib was great, though the wasabi/potato recommended pairing was not for me. liked the gentle truffle taste in the gravy. the potatoes were great. the chicken meatball was very umami. needed a little seasoning on chicken. the pudding, a flan, had a VERY overpowering orange flavor that overshadowed the peach. the mousse cake was rich, chocolatey, bit dense, good."

            "text": "I absolutely loved this Japanese fusion restaurant — the flavors and creativity were spot on!\n\nWe started with the chawanmushi, a delicately steamed egg custard served in a charming teacup. The addition of aged Parmesan was such a delightful twist — as a cheese lover, I was amazed by how perfectly it blended with the dish.\n\nNext came the roasted bone marrow steak tartare, which was easily a 10/10. At first, I thought it was just presented in a marrow bone, but it actually incorporated the rich, juicy marrow into the tartare itself. The depth of flavor was unlike any tartare I’ve had before — incredibly savory and indulgent.\n\nFor mains, we shared the Lingo Beef Pie along with the Grilled Wild Scallion and Corn Donabe Rice. The beef pie was hearty and delicious, while the donabe rice stood out with its bright hint of lemon zest that added such a refreshing kick. The tempura corn and mushrooms on top were the perfect crispy, flavorful touch.\n\nI’d highly recommend dining here — and as a bonus, the restaurant sits right by the waterfront. Coming at sunset, when the sky turns shades of orange and pink over the cityscape, makes the whole experience even more special 🥰"

We got 3 dishes and felt that it was enough to fill between 2 people. What we got:\n\n- Roasted Bone Marrow Steak Tartare: 5/5 - Really enjoyed this dish! It came with several pieces of nori, which paired so well with the fatty bone marrow and fresh uni and tartare.\n- Crispy Potato Mille Feuille: 3.8/5 - Not as big of a deal as ppl make it out to be. Maybe we got an off-batch - ours was a tad undercooked, so it was a bit crunchier than I liked, plus the flavor was nothing life changing.\n- Lingo Beef Pie: 4.5/5 - Pretty good, but superr savory. Docking 1/2 pt bc I wish the dish came with some rice or bread - just something to pair with the curry, but the meat was tasty and tender!\n\nStaff were superr attentive and came around multiple times to refill our cups (granted, the water cups are quite small haha). Overall, would recommend for a decent meal!"

            "text": "They are what I call an affordable fine-dining. The vibe is casually elegant and the food is superb, so top notch! The stone bowl rice with baby corns reminds me of the Cantonese stone bowl rice and the Korean stone bowl bibimbap. The rice is slightly charred by the hot stone bowl, resulting in a nice crunchy texture and it is simmered in the subtle sweetness of corns. 🤤 The octopus is like a Nikkei ceviche. The dessert is an oolong tea soft swerve with white peach, and I love a slightly bitter sweetness which adds depth and layers. What a wonderful fusion of cultures and flavors!"

However\nour server said we must start with the drinks first and she insisted that we place our entire order at once. She mentioned a 30-minute wait for food making us feel rushed and uncomfortable. To make matters worse, they just opened and we were the only customers in the restaurant at the time.\n\nSince it was our first visit, we asked for recommendations, but she simply went through the menu without providing any helpful suggestions.\n\nThe food was okay, but not worth the prices."

Both came with rice, tsukemono, miso soup, onsen egg, and seasonal vegetables. (There's also an optional salmon ikura add-on for $6.)\n\nThe space has a clean, rustic decor that I really loved.

Staff was lovely, but we did have an issue with the hostess. Our reservation was at 12pm, but after my friend was seated (she came a bit late), the hostess said that our table was needed back at 1pm. Although I understand that my friend was late, it was weird that they would only allow an hour of dining/seating. So, throughout our meal we were a bit worried, uncomfortable, and felt rushed.\n\nService aside, the food was amazing. We got the miso caramel pancakes and the beef pie with hokkaido milk bread (you have to order it separately). A perfect blend of sweet and savory brunch. The miso caramel pancakes come in a stack of two, but we just got the single stack to share. It was fluffy, a huge portion, and came with a scoop of ice cream on top. The beef pie was AMAZING, and paired so well with the hokkaido milk bread (which also came with sake butter). Would love to come back here for their dinner service."

The sticky toffee pudding was also a let down. It was so dry, the cake has to be soaked in that toffee. The crispy potatoes with caviar was okay but again the potatoes tasted quite bland.

Meat inside was a lot as well, and the crust was soooo crispy.\n\nThe Mille Feuille potato was outstanding too, my friend liked it a lot. It was delicious but I personally think it would be great to make the potato slightly more salty and make the butter less flavored.\n\nDuck breast was kinda dry but I like the idea that you get to taste it cooked in two different ways.\n\nLast, the sticky toffee pudding.

            "text": "Incredible service and a lovely atmosphere. Food was very solid. I enjoyed the milk bread with miso butter and the octopus carpaccio the most. The chawanmushi was also nice. The beef stew pot pie was a bit too sweet for a savory dish for my liking. We also had the cauliflower, potatoes, and sando. Prepared with a lot of love and expertise. Very good."

Their Japanese breakfast was amazing too but it is something that you can get any other good japanese restaurants. Mushroom ricotta toast was def one of my favorite!Loved everything and can’t wait to go back."

            "text": "The food are so delicious ! Very creative Japanese dishes ! Love everything I had !\nThe bread with the sake butter is gorgeous, I would definitely come back for that again. We also had the Scallop Crudo with pickled berries and jello, so refreshing ! For the main, we had the Lingo Beef Pie, so hearty so filling :) Including the desert toffee pudding, we had 3 dishes served in skillet pans, which keep them warm and cute for the whole dinner.\n\nService is great, art being displayed are great, if theres one thing to improve, it would be the bathroom. they only have a bathroom and there is always a wait, other than that, its wonderful."

            "text": "Edit as I can't reply to owner:\nI just want you to know that we were not offered anything at all at the end of our meal. I was trying to order a dessert at the end because you have one of my favorite British desserts (sticky toffee pudding) but was told only one item did not have egg (the grape ice cream) but at no point was it offered in lieu of your lovely birthday treats being passed around. I do want to let you know that a few things felt a bit exasperating, but I gave the benefit of the doubt each time - when seated, we were given the far corner table away from everyone else, but we thought - oh maybe they're trying to give us privacy. Then when we weren't offered anything for the special occasion I thought to myself, oh it's probably the egg but they could have at least acknowledged me or taken my mocktail off the bill. And then when we saw the coat rack we thought, oh maybe it was full when we came in. But at some point you just realize that the communication is either really poor, or a second thought. If given a choice, I would have picked a different empty table of which there were many. And if offered a celebratory treat I would have appreciated it because Christmas adjacent birthdays are absolutely the worst 😓 and people hate having their coat collect dust on the floor. The food is good but the service really needs a little improvement and consistency. I'm disappointed that whoever told you that we were offered something was not telling the truth.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this place.\n\nI'm going to smack whichever Instagram influencer beguiled me enough to spend my birthday dinner here. I knew immediately when I walked inside and felt overdressed that I probably picked the wrong restaurant for my special occasion. The food is fairly interactive - bone marrow has steak tartar that you assemble with nori which was such an interesting twist on a bone marrow dish. Beef curry pie has a smoldering rosemary stem coming out of a piece of bone marrow but the curry was very one note. The mushroom rice was very unsalted so you missed out on all the great mushroom flavors. Food was good but for the price point it's just not quite good enough.\n\nFor a low key meal this will probably meet expectations, but for the prices here I thought it would be a little more refined, interesting on the palate and proudly served. One very hard working server was taking care of the entire seating area to the best of his ability but there was no sparkling conversation or personalized attentiveness. I think I just set my expectations too high because of all the online accolades. Lighting is very dim so not super great for photos or big energy.\n\nNot only did I watch 4 other ppl get birthday desserts while we were passed up tonight (the special occasion and allergy instructions never made it to the server I'm guessing) but on my way out we see a coat rack and on the coldest night of the year having many layers on we were not offered to have our coats hung up when we walked in. So for a birthday dinner I ended up feeling like I got subpar service, a missed birthday treat (could have gone elsewhere) and an expensive but mediocre meal. Maybe if I just came in for a regular dinner without all the hype I would have been less disappointed. Will not be back though. For half the money you can get better food at Wanpaku."

            "text": "We tried out this new restaurant in greenpoint and i'm giving a 5 star because I believe this restaurant has potential to grow! I love the interior and the vibe of this restaurant. Not sure if its usually loud but as it got later in the night it was hard to hear. The service was very fast and attentive. The cocktails were good I got the Kyuri which was refreshing (not in the pic) and the Hinagiku which is their take on margarita. I particularly was interested if the  yuzu kosho syrup would work well with this cocktail it's a 50/50 for me but i love the shiso salt used. The apps were good my favorite is the steak tartare! it's a must order! The Tempura sweet corn and garlic scape and bread was okay. For the main course we asked for the skirt steak and beef pie. We asked medium rare for the doneness however i think it came out well done. Also if you eat the skirt steak as is, it's slightly salty but if you eat it together with the carrots and the sauce it brings out a different flavor profile! (i also love the carrots) The beef pie looked aesthetically pleasing. The first bite was really good and the beef was tender however it tasted slightly burned. We enjoyed our time everybody was very nice and shout out to our waitress Wahita she was kind and attentive.  I also would love to see a seasonal menu in the near future!"

They were mostly average but the desserts (especially the panna cotta) tasted funny to me. Overall I’d say the restaurant is alright but definitely expensive. Their classification is accurate so go in expecting western food inspired by Japanese cuisine, but the flavor is not going to be Japanese."
