The front house is very respectful and interactive with their customers, from the moment I walked in they greeted me with real genuine smiles and were super patient taking my order. It’s very rare to find a great spot that go above and beyond for their customers."

The staff brings a lot of energy and friendliness, creating a fun and upbeat atmosphere that makes it a great spot for families and groups.

            "text": "I had really high hopes for this place given all the social media hype, but honestly, it was a major letdown. The “smash burgers” here are shockingly small — more like sliders than actual burgers. You’d expect a hearty, satisfying meal for what they charge, but instead you get something that disappears in three bites.\n\nTo make things worse, the burgers are overly greasy and oily, leaving the bun soggy and the wrapper soaked through. It’s the kind of heavy oiliness that doesn’t add flavor — it just makes you feel gross afterward. The patties themselves had very little seasoning, and the parve cheese tasted cheap and processed.\n\nAnd then there’s the price — completely unjustified for what you get. By the time you add fries and a drink, you’re paying a premium price for what feels like a kids’ meal portion. There are so many better kosher burger options in Brooklyn offering bigger, better-tasting food at a lower cost.\n\nOverall, this place feels like it’s surviving off social media hype rather than actual quality. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you enjoy being overcharged for small, greasy burgers. Definitely not worth the trip or the money."
