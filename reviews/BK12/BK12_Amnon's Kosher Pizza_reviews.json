If you can't properly serve customers until 11:00, don't advertise a 9:00 opening time!"

Pizza is delicious, and they have many different types of foods, falafel, salads, drinks, and much much more. All the food they prepare is always delicious, fresh, and piping hot. Space to eat is spacious, neat, and clean, always spik and span. Service is amazing, pizza comes quickly, and salads are made on the spot. Would definitely recommend this pizza store to just about everyone I know in town. Overall an amazing experience eating here, or even taking the food out."
