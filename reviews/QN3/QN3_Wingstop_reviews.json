The fries were not only soggy but also burnt, which was utterly disappointing. As for the bone-in wings, they were completely overcooked. The outer layer was so hard that it was nearly impossible to bite into. The seasoning was indistinguishable because the wings were cooked to such an extreme.\nThat said, the chicken tenders were surprisingly good. I would definitely recommend those. However, for a place called “WINGSTOP”, the wings really missed the mark."
