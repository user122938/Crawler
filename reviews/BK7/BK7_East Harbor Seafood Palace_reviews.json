The phoenix claws & shrimp dumplings are mandatory!\n\nIt’s always busy so you know the food is fresh. Avoid weekends unless you come early otherwise expect 30-45 minutes wait time.\n\nLimited Valet parking based on availability. Can park bicycle inside the garage. 👍👍\n\nElevate your dining experience. Go big & get the 8 lbs king crab 🦀 🦀\n\nupdate:\nAnother great evening with buddy for the 10 lbs crab (a 3 course meal in itself ). Complemented with an Austin Hope from Paso Robles, CA.\n\n$800 dinner tab for 2 is a first for me. Highly recommended 😉😉"

On top of that, she spoke my hometown dialect and constantly interrupted our family conversation, which felt extremely rude and unprofessional.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes looked nice, but the flavors were nowhere near what they used to be. It really seems like they’ve changed the chef. The Vancouver Crab Lotus Leaf Rice was especially awful—the sticky rice was far too greasy and completely lacked any lotus leaf aroma.\n\nConsidering the high prices, the overall quality was very poor. Definitely not coming back."

            "text": "Visited a handful of times before. Today (Wednesday) I went around 11am and it was pretty packed. Wait time was around 10-15 minutes. When you enter, be sure to tell the staff member in front how many is in your party for the table and he will give you a card with a number on it. As tables start to clear, he will yell out the numbers, based on availability. You want to be attentive here as if you don’t acknowledge your number being called, it will be skipped and he will quickly move on to the next numbers for people to be seated. During my 10 minute wait, I saw people who were there before me, that didn’t get a card with a number on it, and they just stood around. After they saw what everyone else was doing, they finally got a number so they could be called for a table.\n\nAlso fyi, if you come when they open at 9am, there will already be a decent sized crowd waiting outside. Lines do not exist here though. When the doors open, imagine a Black Friday sale, but for seats. Families and individuals will run for the table they want to occupy during their meal. It’s a bit of rush! After that initial opening, about 60% of the restaurant will be filled. Then around 30 minutes later, the entire place will be packed and the above mentioned waiting  for your number to be called will start.\n\nThe dimsum here was decent! My review says 4 stars but I really mean 4.5 stars. Too bad half stars don’t yet exist on Yelp. They really should make that an option. Anyway, the dimsum here is very authentic, flavorful, and great portions! I brought my dad here and he says it’s also pretty decent - fyi, he cooks for a living. We also loved it so much that at the end of our meal, we ordered take out of dimsum to take back to the rest of my family.\n\nThe restaurant is filled with locals, a few tourists, but mostly Cantonese families with small children, elderly people, and young get-togethers. You can sort of hear people talking in other tables, but that’s to be expected in any dimsum place with locals. It’s moderate volume but still on the quieter side for how busy it gets and in comparison to other dimsum restaurants.\n\nStaff here are friendly and attentive. Also super efficient. They bring everything you ask for within a minute- in my experience today. I asked for chili oil and water. Also plenty of refills for tea (for the tea, proper etiquette to ask for more refills is to lift the lid slightly and let it rest on top, so it stays open and they know to come get it).\n\nAlso… absolutely love the hot sauce/chili oil here!!! So good we asked for 3 and I used 2.5 of them. My dad who doesn’t even like spicy much, used half of one. I put chili oil on most dim sum dishes to really elevate the already-decent flavors!\n\nWould still come back again!"

Many of the customers, my party included, have to share the table with other an another party. If this is not to your liking, then you may need to find another place, come in a very large party, or ask and wait for a table for just your party.\n\nThe food is what you typically see in other dim sum places. I admit, there were several dishes that I have yet to see such as abalone on top of the steamed beef balls (ngao yuk). It was delicious, the abalone was flavorful and not too chewy, while the beef ball was perfectly steamed with a hint of seafood from the abalone. I do wish that they had a bit more variety though. It could be that they were busy and the aunties stuck with the popular dishes, but I do wish they went around with some uncommon ones too."

You have to get a card with an assigned number to be placed in the queue for seating. Wait time could be 30 min+.\n\nWhen you get seated, they will give you a punch card and ask you if you want tea, they have a few flavors to choose from, but I personally recommend the 普洱茶 （pu er tea). After you get the tea, you just wait for the dimsum carts to roll around. Each cart carries different items so keep an eye out for what you like or want to try. Every dish that I got was packed with flavor and was absolutely delicious, but I’d highly recommend getting the beef rib and the chicken feet! They also have a separate menu if you want to try other made-to-order dishes. So let the staff know if that peaks your curiosity.\n\nOnce you choose your dimsum it goes straight from the cart to your table and they’ll place a stamp on your punch card to denote the cost category of what you just picked up. When you’ve finished eating, ask one of employees that’s wearing a vest to calculate the bill total and take that punch card to the table by the front entrance to pay your bill. Be sure to leave some tip at your dining table for the staff!\n\nHaving said all of that, this is likely the most flavorful and delicious dimsum place I’ve ever been to!!! Happy Dimsuming."

Followed by a nice lady. So if you are dining alone or party of 2 be prepared to share a table. It was also really really loud. I had headphones on and I could not hear the show I was trying to watch.\n\nBut the food is top notch. The pork and beef ribs were amazing. The porridge was perfection. Only better place was in China. The yellow spongy cake thing was really good. Just the right amount of sweetness and fluffy. The taro thing was crispy. Shrimp and veggie dumpling was delicious.\n\nWill definitely go back but maybe a Tuesday or snow day in hopes of less people. I also want to bring my family here next time they visit."

Located in Brooklyn Chinatown, where there is a sizable Cantonese immigrant population, this establishment has a long history and preserves the authentic flavors of dim sum.\n\nThey serve food through pushcarts, offering a variety of dishes not found in many other places, and their prices are cheaper compared to dim sum in Manhattan and Flushing. Additionally, they have a menu where you can order dim sum or stir-fried dishes not available on the carts.\n\nPatrons range from elderly to young, leisurely sipping tea and enjoying dim sum, and sometimes during peak dining hours, sharing tables might be necessary, but this communal atmosphere adds to the charm of the experience.\n\nHighly recommended for those who appreciate traditional dim sum."

But the shrimp with orange sauce (which our waiter advise us to get with mayonnaise sauce, which we did) was flat out amazing. The shrimp were delicious and the broccoli… Some of the best we have ever had. The steamed dumplings were the best we've had since returning from California.

We’ve tried almost everything on the menu and dim sum carts. I can’t even count how many times I’ve been here, and finally decided to give them an honorable mention.\n\nThe aunties who push the dim sum carts are really attentive and friendly — they remember our fav food and always reserve us warm dim sum.\n\nJust found out East Harbor was listed in 2023 Michelin Guide — very well-deserved.\n\nTop favs/Must order:\n＊Veggie Pork Bun 菜肉包\n＊Char Siu Pie 叉燒酥\n＊Char Siu Bun 叉燒餐包\n＊Taro Dumpling 香芋餃\n＊Black Sesame Balls 雷沙湯圓\n＊Egg Tart 蛋撻\n\nOther Favs:\n＊Dried Shrimp Rice Roll 蝦米腸\n＊Beef w.

Unfortunately, they ran out of rice porridge, which is something that really tells us about a Dim Sum Restaurant's ability to serve quality food.\n\nIt didn't take long to get a seat, but the place was filled. I can only imagine what it is like on weekends. I would return to eat again, but you can get similar quality dim sum in Flushing and NYC Chinatown."

Service here is great also, friendly staff. Weekends there's always a long wait cuz it's good food here. Weekdays are still crowded but easier to get seats. Dinner service is family style Chinese and it's fire also, just need to know how to order. If you're a foreigner bring a Chinese friend with you! You'll have a great time."
