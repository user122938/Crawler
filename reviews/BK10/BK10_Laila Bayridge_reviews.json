Toward the end of the evening, the staff asked if we wanted to place anything before the kitchen closed, and we ordered a main dish for my friend. However, the order was never brought to the table. After waiting for almost an hour with no updates—and without anyone checking in to offer water or ask if we needed anything—we asked about the dish. At that point, we were told the kitchen had already closed and that the order had never even been placed.\n\nThe food we did receive was fine, but the lack of attention, communication, and basic service overshadowed the entire visit. For a first impression, this was very disappointing, and I hope the restaurant works on training its staff to be more attentive and reliable."

When we were seated we were able to order drinks, then we ordered appetizers, and then ordered entrees. Appetizers came before drinks and did not get water until we asked for it. Waitress was also apologetic when she spilled the appetizer and brought us a new one. When entrees came a while later we tried to order more drinks but nobody came to our table for a long time. After we ordered second round of drinks, we noticed it took a while and the bar ended up running out of glasses. There was also only 1 bartender for the whole restaurant of many tables and additional people sitting st the bar. There should probably be more than 1 on prime Saturday night.\n\nDj was awesome though! Everyone was nice, but very clear they were understaffed for the night. Food was delicious, and we all left full. Spent a little over $100 per person. We all shared apps and entrees, got 1-2 drinks per person as well."

If it’s your first day in Brooklyn or even if you’ve lived here a thousand years, even if this was your very first experience with food, you have to come here. Starting from the basics, the ambience and the overall air of the environment invites you in. There’s a section facing the outside that has the most gorgeous canopy of greenery and it becomes even more beautiful as the evening approaches and the table lighting flourishes. The food is divine, and the service even more so. Each worker has their own story to tell and the warmest energy. If it was my first time dining here, I would just put all my trust into Rania and Roger and let the show of flavors commence. Tina provided such sweet and very patient service, she was so helpful and kind. Arda is a very thoughtful and kind bartender with magical talents who produces absolute artwork and mastery of the craft. They are all so amazing, with the best smiles and friendliest interactions. And it’s truly a beautiful spirit that flows through the space, the people, and the food."

We came late on a Saturday night and Rania greeted us and let us order before the kitchen closed. She even helped us choose foods she recommended. Everything was delicious, fresh, and tender. My husband and I were in a food and flavor coma. We tried to leave a cash tip but she was honest and told us on Friday and Saturday night an 18% tip was included. We wouldn’t have caught that on the receipt so that was kind of her. Still left a little extra cash for the busboys. I would definitely come back here and next time save room for dessert!"

The filet mignon I got was tender and the seasoned fries were tasty. They have a huge menu so there’s always more to explore. I recommend this place for a special occasion, date, or birthday.

It’s always a great feeling when a place lives up to (or even exceeds) expectations. The service was just as wonderful, friendly, attentive, and welcoming.

Not only did they go above and beyond to accommodate me- the service was excellent- but that’s all nice and all- here’s the best part- the food is phenomenal. Food is seriously legit- it taste like someone’s grandmother made each dish- the quality and portions are excellent. Food is super flavorful without being overly seasoned- good quality cuts of meat- I highly recommend all the appetizers - all the lamb dishes-fattet Mozat-  shish tawook-mix grill- meat shawarma platter, no joke everything is insanely good. There’s quite a few Lebanese Syrian and Palestinian places in bay ridge - none of them come even close to this. Also on a Friday night 8pm they had a belly dancer who was wonderful- can’t wait to come back. Portions are huge and prices are fair and on par with the quality of the food- also fyi- there’s a full bar for those who drink alcohol. Excellent to bring kids - we had 8 kids in our group of 17"
