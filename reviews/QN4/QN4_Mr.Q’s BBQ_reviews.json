Everything tasted really good and well prepared, hospitality was great. For the whole experience it is very affordable.\n\nBeen here a few times now and it doesn’t disappoint.\n\nBen is a great host and helped make everything easier and cleared up any questions.\n\nCome give it a try, who doesn’t love meat on a stick?"

Mainly, I ordered the 麻辣香锅 . 36 dollars, and there was very little beef, lotus root, and seafood. It was literally almost all cauliflower. An absolute ripoff. Look at the photo for proof. Go to Flushing for a more authentic and affordable experience."

I hope others will confirm with them again and again when placing an order, otherwise this situation will happen, as if they are forcing us to buy or sell."

I’ve tried so many bbq skewer spots in Brooklyn and flushing but this place takes the crown. Their skewers are grilled to perfection and the spices are just right. I love the beef, gizzard, and chicken skin skewer the best. The garlic grilled oysters were soooo good too. I came on a Saturday night with my husband and it was so quiet (only one other table). I really hope business picks up soon and more people find out about them so they can stay in business and then I can keep coming!! Highly recommended - run, don’t walk !!!"

The selection of skewers is impressive—from savory meats to flavorful vegetables, all seasoned just right with bold spices that pack a punch.

The staff were friendly and efficient, and the service was quick even during busy hours.\n\nIf you're a fan of Chinese-style skewers and smoky, spicy flavors, this place is definitely worth checking out.
