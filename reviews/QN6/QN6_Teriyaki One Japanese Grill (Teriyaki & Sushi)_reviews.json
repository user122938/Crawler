When I got home I realized that one of the meals had no vegetables and they both had rice that was so old. Nothing about the rice was fresh; it was aggressively dry and unpleasant to eat. They also don’t pickup their phones and that explains why their receipt says that they don’t accept refunds, returns or exchanges. I’ve never had a problem with Teriyaki one before. This location has been a hit and miss for something that I eat regularly. The rice was definitely frozen and then barely reheated which is unacceptable for this early in the day."

            "text": "Teriyaki one/junction blvd.\nNow I try not to be a hard critique when patronizing these take out restaurants, especially if it is a place that I like and have frequented quite often. I usually go to this teriyaki spot on my lunch break ,and I have become very acquainted with the poke bowl since it it mostly seafood (shrimp, crabmeat) and salad, I have read the menu several times when ordering to make sure I am not getting an unwanted food item,(I don’t eat meat, to include chicken/lamb/beef, of any kind), I also have food allergies, mainly ( and I don’t know how, or why) zucchini. This food item is not listed as an item in the poke bowl, and I have ordered this many times, never has it ever had zucchini or cucumbers. I go in today for my usual order, as I am sitting in my car to have my lunch, I get past the top layer, and just under the second layer…WHAT DO I SEE? I almost had a heart attack, the food item that will have my throat closing in 2.2 seconds. I jump out of my car and run back across the street to have this order corrected, they tried to tell me nooo,it’s cucumber, very unconcerned, I said absolutely not,… MY THROAT WILL CLOSE!, they offered to make the order over, my issue is, there was no apology or anything remotely close, I said all of that to say, to this establishment you need to be much more careful, if you do not have an item listed, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT put it in the food order, you don’t know what a person could be allergic to. This could have gone terribly wrong"

Whoever was taking the order refused to do it and insisted it had to come with rice or noodles only. Maybe they need to be trained better.\n\nPS - Here’s a screenshot of the order screen on uber eats where you can see “Only Vegetables” is an option.\n\nEDIT: Got our food and not only did he not let us order as we wanted, he got one of the orders wrong and we received fried rice instead of white rice. And look at this sad little portion of vegetables!"

I was very happy with how quick the service was, how much food I got and of course the price point. It’s nothing fancy or out of this world but the portion is great, staff was friendly and wait time was fast. No complaints! Will definitely be stopping by again to try the sushi."
