            "text": "\"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.\" – Virginia Woolf\n\nBay Café in Brooklyn is proof of that. Whether you sit outside by the water or inside in the cozy dining room, the atmosphere makes you feel instantly at ease. We enjoyed a glass of vino to start, followed by dishes that played with the taste buds in all the right ways—the flaky, perfectly cooked sea bass, rich truffle mushroom pizza, fresh tiradito de tuna, crispy fish tempura, and a simple yet flawless spaghetti pomodoro. The decadent Dubai chocolate dessert was the ideal sweet finale. Great and attentive service, warm hospitality from owner Larisa, and flavors you’ll think about long after you leave. After dinner, a walk around the bay is the perfect ending to a wonderful evening."

The Margherita pizza was delicious,  the Pao de Queijo is gluten free and was so flavorful and soft. Must order kachapuri....they would never find this in their home country and were impressed by the bread , the consistency of the cheese and the runny egg. ( fyi bring lactaid pills for this dish if lactose intolerant, it swims with butter). The Caesar salad with its giant homemade croutons, finely shredded parmesan was refreshing, as was the strawberry hibiscus Boba tea."

Crab Cakes were crunchy outside, juicy and tender inside, had a unique taste and was truly amazing.\nAll in all-very satisfying experience, would love to try more dishes from their vast menu and dine there in person."

For mains we had the spinach/cheese Ravioli and a Mediterranean Bronzino which I personally could not have asked for more. The Bronzino was so perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection and the flavors could be tasted in the meat of the fish not just the crispy skin. A def must have when you come here.

Seriously so fresh and tasty, and I can honestly say it was one of the best gnocchi I ever had!\n\nHalloumi salad - it was basic, nothing special.\n\nLasagna Frittas: this was different and yummy. It came with an Alfredo dipping sauce which elevated it even further and made it heavenly.\n\nFish tacos - they were ok, the fish had a good crunch but otherwise it was dry. I dipped it into the Alfredo sauce from the frittas and it tasted good like that.\n\nThe interior is a bit outdated but overall it’s a nice ambience and they have good service.\n\nFor more kosher reviews on Instagram @kosherfoodworld"

I split the “crab cakes” and the mozzarella sticks with a friend. Crab cakes were a little lackluster (more vegetables than “crab”) but the mozzarella sticks were yummy. Crab cakes made up for it with a surprise salad which was tasty. My friend ordered fish and felt it was very fresh. A cozy place to chill with friends!"

The warm, inviting atmosphere makes it a great spot for a family meal, a casual date, or a special night out. The modern decor is paired with subtle touches that create a relaxed yet refined setting.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, the attentive service set the tone for the evening. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, ensuring that all my questions were answered and that I felt welcomed throughout my visit.\n\nThe menu, which changes seasonally to highlight fresh ingredients, offers an impressive range of kosher dairy dishes. I began with one of their signature thin-crust pizzas—a perfect balance of a crispy, flavorful base and a medley of high-quality toppings. For the main course, the Porcini Mushroom Crusted Sea Bass was outstanding; it boasted a beautifully seared exterior and a tender, flaky interior that showcased the chef's dedication to flavor and presentation. Another highlight was the Maple Ginger Glazed Salmon, a dish that cleverly melded sweet and savory notes for a delightful culinary experience.\n\nOverall, The Bay Cafe excels in delivering not just a meal but a complete dining experience. Its commitment to innovative, seasonal cuisine, combined with a welcoming environment and excellent service, makes it a standout destination in Brooklyn. Whether you’re planning a casual outing or a celebratory dinner, The Bay Cafe is definitely worth a visit."

Additionally, I ordered a matcha drink which was described as slushed, but it ended up being quite watery instead.\n\nAnother disappointment was the Greek salad I ordered, which didn't align with what I saw in the Google reviews. It seemed like the dish had undergone some revisions that didn't deliver the same experience as mentioned by others.\n\nThe pricing at this restaurant is on the higher side, which didn't seem justified considering the average quality of the food.
