            "text": "I rarely leave reviews, but my family and I had such a disappointing experience at Underhill Cafe that I felt it was important to share. From the moment we arrived, no one acknowledged us no greeting, no welcome, nothing. We patiently waited to be seated, only to watch multiple parties who came in after us get seated and served right away.\n\nIt was disheartening and honestly infuriating to be treated as if we were invisible. We ultimately decided to leave and take our business elsewhere. I can’t say for certain if this was discriminatory, but it felt that way especially seeing white customers arrive later and receive immediate service.\n\nNo one should have to question whether they’re being treated differently because of who they are. Do better."

But what really surprised me was the avgolemono soup… honestly, it was better than homemade! Creamy, tangy, and comforting — just like something straight out of a Greek kitchen. The staff was friendly, the place cozy, and everything came out fresh. Definitely my new go-to spot!"

The menu has something for everyone and I love that their brunch options come with coffee or tea + a brunch beverage (e.g., mimosa/bellini/sangria). We knew before even ordering that we’d be coming back again for dinner as there are so many dishes we want to try!\nWe enjoyed all of the following:\n- Saganaki (The star of the show! Incredible, a must-try!)\n- Lumberjack Breakfast with eggs over easy and sausage (sausage was only ok)\n- Greek salad\n- Eggs Benedict with prosciutto\nA special thanks to Laura who took care of us, was so kind and attentive, and gave great recommendations!"

As it cooled down, it was unfortunately no more appetizing than it looked. It was dry and salty. I don't know lamb enough to know if it was overcooked, but then I remembered the aioli. I had specifically ordered it for the garlic aioli, and I couldn't find it.\n\nI asked the waitress, whose kind demeanor was the only nice part of the meal. She checked with the kitchen. They didn't have the aioli, so they had just left it off without saying anything.\n\nThe check came - they charged me $23.50 for an incomplete burger that wasn't tasty enough to finish. Then after I left the tip, they snuck on an additional 3% credit card fee."

My original review is below, so I am only writing this in the hopes someone at Underhill takes it to heart, as I know it’s such a great spot.\n\n2020:\nIf you love Greek food, don’t miss this place! We have only had their delivery but it always comes quickly and the food is delicious. You HAVE to get the lamb burger — non negotiable. It is so good with crispy cheese on the bottom. Mmm. The spanikopita was a bit soggy but flavor is great. We love this spot."
