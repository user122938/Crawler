Both were alright, the rice has a citrus note to it and the white sauce and hot sauce helped with the chicken a little. The hummus has a pleasant nutty taste and I ended the meal with the baklava that was not too sweet. Paid around 15 including tax. Its different from the Halal carts I have eaten at (Mido's, Adel's Famous Halal Food, Habibi's Halal Food) and the kind man answered all the questions I had."

The lentil soup was delicious as well as the hummus. But the falafel‘s were amazing. I’ve honestly never had such good falafel: moist, but crunchy and flakey. Perfectly salted.
