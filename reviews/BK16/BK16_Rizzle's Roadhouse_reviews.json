Food is somewhat expensive for two people expect to pay about $100 dollars but it depends on what you order too, and if you’re drinking alcohol that is what doubles and triples that $100 dollars."

We also tried the perogies and the fish and it was the best I have had in a long time.\n\nWhether you're stopping by for a casual dinner or looking for a place to unwind with friends, Rizzle's Roadhouse delivers. Great food, great service, and a great time. We'll definitely be back."

I loved the fresh cut French fries they were hot and seasoned perfectly. My husband had the whole wings and he chose their “Rizzle” signature sauce flavor. The recipe is a secret but I would say it’s a delicious garlicky mild sauce.. it’s really good!  The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. The place has so much charm and fun accents yet the restaurant and bathrooms were both very clean which I notice. Overall I would give it 10/10 and I can’t wait to go back!! Loved it"

The highlight of the meal was the crabcakes, which were truly exceptional—packed with real crab meat instead of filler, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Paired with a side of fresh steamed broccoli, it was both simple and delicious.\nThe service was excellent—friendly, attentive, and made the whole experience feel welcoming without being rushed. On top of that, the prices were very reasonable, making it easy to enjoy a high-quality meal without breaking the bank.\nOverall, Rizzle’s Roadhouse offers a wonderful balance of affordability, great food, and attentive service. If you’re looking for a place where you can get both quality and value, I’d highly recommend giving this spot a try."

The Server was super friendly and the cook hand delivered some if their custom dishes such as the Pennsylvania Perogi Platter with a smile. Idk who was more excited lol. It was delicious. Im old fashioned and got a burger and fresh cut fries and it was cooked to perfection. The meat was freshly prepared. We will absolutely stop back here to the great food and vibes! Also awesome 80's and 90's jams im a sucker for. Awesome job guys! We will be back 100%"

Their special was a NY strip dinner for 15.99, so I figured it would be less than impressive for that price.  I was pleasantly surprised and their cook did a perfect \"rare\".  My mom had the walleye and loved it.  Our waitress was great. They had a bunch of happy hour drink specials.  The prices are lower than most places... I thought they must have forgotten to charge us for something because the bill was alot lower than we expected.  They have an extensive menu, so we will definitely be back."

However, on our last visit prior to this one, the service was unfortunately terrible, which made us hesitant to return for a while.\n\nThat changed recently when we decided to give it another try on wing night—and we’re so glad we did! The wings were absolutely the best we’ve ever had there, and the service completely turned around our experience.\n\nOur server, Megan, was phenomenal. Friendly, attentive, and efficient, she made sure everything was perfect from start to finish. Honestly, Megan is the best server we’ve ever had at this restaurant. Her exceptional service really made our night.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back again—and next time, we’ll make sure Megan is working before we go. She made all the difference!"

            "text": "Had a suprise party there. Chris the owner went above and beyond for my party. Chris catered all of the food, and it all was absolutely amazing. We had chicken, salad pizza and pasta for the party. The pasta was so good, those meatballs were the best I have ever had.  The staff was the greatest we all could ask for, those  women took care of my whole party,  asked repeatedly if i needed help setting up and still took care of their regular customers. The room was very large with plenty of seating, we had 52 people and had alot of space. If you ever need a place to have a get together, go see Chris. I highly recommend this place and will be returning for more experiences there. They also have a outside screened in patio for those summer get together."

The prices are competitive and the owner is very present in the establishment. If I could recommend anything specific I would say the whole wings and I am a sucker for a good Rueben."

He and the server made a great working pair. They worked their butts off waiting on us and other customers. Owner even gave my kids little ice cream cups!  Love that it is no smoking now! We will be back for sure!"

We got Wings and Fries with Beer cheese (waitress brought cold nacho cheese but another waitress helped us and brought out warm beer cheese) I don't know if our waitress was new or what but we asked a few questions about menu items and she had no clue of ingredients. But that won't stop us from going back! Wings were fantastic by the way!!"
