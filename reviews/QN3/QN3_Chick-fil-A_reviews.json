Asked if they had grilled chicken sandwiches at this hour, and they respectfully said no, they’ll serve that in lunch hours, starting 10:30. I bought a Chick-Fil-A biscuit, and it tasted SO GOOD! Fully cooked. The Hash Browns tasted great! Crispy and it gives you the delight. The entire store wasn’t busy. But overall, even if it is expensive, you will be able to feel great here and have good food!"

Thank you for your great customer service. It does not go unnoticed! Thank you for Aman for sending rewards to my Chick Fil A account from time to time. I don't eat fast food alot because I try to eat healthier but when I see a reward drop in my account from Aman, I go and order other items as well.  Thank you so much! I go to support this Chick Fil A cause I want this place to last in this area. Thank you again."

Then 20 because i recounted it . Safe to say ill be keeping an eye out for that specific girl and then the other one who also lied again after . I felt so belittled and disrespected because why cant you give me what i paid for . And btw no such policy exist so I’m definitely gonna let them have it next time . Long story short , my order was supposed to come with close to 40 sauces but they only gave me 20 because of some apparent policy , theyre liars .

I order via the app ahead of time to pick-up/take-out as I am on lunch break and tick-tock goes the clock. The majority of the time, the staffers are friendly, greet you with a smile, ask whether you are ordering or picking up, ask for the last 4 digits of your phone number and you're good to go! This evening, I entered about an hour before closing, three staffers looked right at me and as I approached the pick-up area on the to-go/late night side, they just walked away. No greeting, no \"Hey, we'll be with you in a second.\", literally nothing at all. Granted, they were preparing to close, as some folks were moping, but my order was already prepared, and waiting in the pick-up area. There were no delivery app folks or any other customers inside the store...sad to say, I just grabbed my order and walked out. This was the first time this situation occurred here, and it was very questionable behavior from food service employees from an establishment that has a reputation of being top tier in customer satisfaction."

I asked the cashier when did this location open and he said that they have been there for a little over two years and you honestly cannot tell at all.\n\nA lot of the Chick-Fil-A locations down in the south are very dirty and doesn’t live up to the expectations you would have. This location however, was completely different. I would definitely come back to this location. It is a nice quiet environment with a lot of tables and space to sit. I would even have a nice study session here."

Turns out they didn’t bother making it because they couldn’t confirm I was on my way because my tracking wasn’t on 🙃 imagine my frustration when I get there 25 minutes later after dealing with getting my kids in the car and “city traffic” and couldn’t just pick up my order. The server offered a spicy biscuit to which I politely declined and walked out extremely annoyed. Truly the worst experience I’ve ever had with this franchise. Why in the world would I order ahead and not want my order made until I arrive? For all of that I would just order on site with a cashier since it shows that it doesn’t save any time to order ahead. Needless to say I added a secondary Dunkin order and shocker, both food orders were ready for me to grab and go by the time I arrived there-and I don’t have tracking on that app either. I did get my refund with them by the end of the day since the order was never filled, I didn’t have to do anything as the cashier explained, it happens automatically. The company needs to do better as a whole with the online ordering if this is the case though. Because again, if I’m ordering ahead for an ASAP pick up or a specific time with any other fast food establishment, for the ones I’ve used so far, it’s always ready/almost done by the time I arrive and doesn’t need a tracker. Walmart and BJs are the only trackers and that’s to simply let them know you’re on the way so they can move your order to a tote or cart and check in when you arrive so they can bring it to you. But that doesn’t mean they’re trying to shop your 50+ cart while you drive to their store because that would be stupid. And they even shoot you a text letting you know your order is ready for pick up so you don’t bother leaving earlier than needed. Very disappointing Chic, very disappointing.\n\n*update: I’ve read your response, however, the email address provided to contact directly is invalid as my email got a kickback saying the delivery was a failure as the address is not found (and i clicked the email directly to compose my message). 🙃"

            "text": "I have always experienced phenomenal customer service from chick-fil-a…until today. I placed a DoorDash order, as usual - and called the location to ask that cheese not be placed on the salad I ordered. Something I’ve done before with no issue. This very simple request has always been met with accommodation, as I always explain that I’m allergic to dairy and DoorDash doesn’t allow for certain ingredients to be omitted from the menu items. The manager I spoke to who said her name was Armeena told me this could not be done. She very aggressively asked for the name of the workers that had done this before and said she would report them because it is “against policy” to modify a menu item from a DoorDash order. She told me to take it up with DoorDash, and that she would not accommodate my request to not put cheese on the salad even if I’m allergic to dairy. I asked for her name, and told her I would take it up with chick-fil-a customer service instead. I cannot believe how insanely rude and unaccommodating she was, and as a long term chick-fil-a customer this was the opposite of any interaction I’ve ever had with any employee from chick-fil-a. Very disappointing and even more disheartening that I will be receiving a salad that I cannot consume that I paid for. Not that this matters but my entire order was almost 100 dollars tonight and a simple request to not put cheese on a salad couldn’t be accommodated? Hopefully this can bring a change to how this manager interacts with patrons."
