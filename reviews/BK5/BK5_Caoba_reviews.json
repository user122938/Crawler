I questioned her she goes. Oh it’s not a problem. It’s just a dollar here you can have a dollar ….it’s not about it being a dollar it’s the principal  if you tell me how much it is and you charge me more,  than you’re robbing me on the DL. THEY  have so many people behind the counter for what all the spit conversations by the food. It makes no sense having 10 people behind the counter just standing there.\n‼️‼️‼️BTW Stay away from the salmon. It looks pretty yet its dry."

You can grab lunch options as early as 9am from their daily cafeteria style options if you’re going to a job site where there aren’t any places to eat. Or if you’re simply on your way home. You can also order specific dishes from the menu if you’re not in a rush since those are made to order or simply call ahead. There is limited seating at high shared counter tops along the two windows for about seven people. The staff are kind & bilingual speaking English and Spanish."

Sometimes the food is salty, but the flavor is there & I do like the food is not greasy.\nI took off 1 star for the overall rating because the prices compared to the portions are truly ridiculous. Why is rice with ONE chicken $7??? This should have been a $5 meal. Especially because they put little rice compared to other Dominican spots. But the one piece of chicken for $7 upset me 😂"

I wanted to add a small portion of mashed potatoes to my plate but they said it's charged as an additional side since I already have rice.\n\nThe presentation is excellent, the food looks and tastes great my only gripe is the chicken could have been cooked more. It's good as flavor goes and the portion is filling. Definetely the best spanish food in the area as others tend to be more salty. The staff seem nice.\n\nFor the largest bottle of water and my meal, I paid about $12."
