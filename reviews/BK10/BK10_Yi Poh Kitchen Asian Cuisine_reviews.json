The place is very clean and well-maintained, which made me feel comfortable and welcomed right away. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the service was quick and smooth.\n\nI ordered the beef noodles, and they were absolutely delicious. The noodles were soft but chewy, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. The beef was tender, juicy, and seasoned just right. You could really tell the ingredients were fresh and made with care. The portion size was generous too — I felt full and happy without paying a lot.\n\nWhat I really liked about Yi Poh Kitchen is that it has a nice, calm environment. It’s clean, peaceful, and perfect for a casual lunch or dinner. Whether you’re eating alone or with friends or family, it feels like a cozy spot to enjoy your meal.\n\nThe prices are very affordable, especially for the quality of food you get. It’s a great place if you’re looking for good food on a budget. Everything is in good condition, from the chairs to the restrooms, and you can tell they care about keeping the place nice for customers."

            "text": "Ipoh Kitchen is a popular Malaysian restaurant in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. It was recommended by my relative's malaysian friend, so I assumed their dishes are quite authentic.\n\nWe went there in a group of 8 so we ordered a whole spread of their signatures. Our all-time favorite is def the Grilled Satay Chicken (we tried satay beef before it wasn't as good).\n\nOur recs:\n- Grilled Satay Chicken\n- Hainanese chicken (whole)\n- Sizzling Black Pepper Beef\n- Saraug Burong\n- Ipoh Coffee\n\nNot recommend:\n- Ipoh Fried Pearl Noodle\n- Golden Spare Ribs\n\nIn general, their dishes were indeed flavorful, yet quite oily and heavy for my liking. Better get Iced Ipoh Coffee to quench your thirst (very rich and creamy!)"
