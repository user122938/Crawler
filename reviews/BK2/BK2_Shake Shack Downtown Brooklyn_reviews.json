Upon finishing my food, putting my cheese fries in my bag for departure after dining in, I decided to order another burger.  There was a gentleman in front of me ordering and I was next.  When I approached the register with my belongings and shake shack bag in my hand, the flamboyant gentleman at the register between 12:30pm and 1:00pm approached me with unnecessary hostility because he assumed with me having a shake shack bag in my hand, I was coming to \"complain\".  The fact that I was even approached like that threw me off guard and I told him I didn't come here for any issue, I'm simply trying to order.  I provided three dollar gratuity as a courtesy too.  Nevertheless, I understand in this world you have to be aware and alert, but to deliberately approach someone because of your own assumption is totally unnecessary, wrong and unprofessional.  Work on your skillset and approach on paying customers because what I brushed off, others may not.  Again, my first pick up experience went very well, the second experience was confrontational.  This review is based on my visit July 7th, 2025."

The drinks are good depending on what you get like sunset lemonade & yuzu honey lemonade but the dragonfruit lemonade was okay tasted kinda bad like 5.5 mid similar to medicine water.

My second time trying it I got two burgers, chicken bites and a drink. The burgers was the $6.99 ones. First of all the whole meal was salty. They probably changed chefs or someone dont know what they were doing. I literally struggled to finish the meal. The chicken bites was salty and small for $5 and change. I was going to take it back to them but I said forget it I don't like conflict. I was even going to give it to a homless man outside because I thought he would enjoy it. This was my second and last time here.\n\nMy friend order cheese fries and said it lack salt. The amount of salt I got was probably for his meal"

My order was absolutely disgusting. The patty was THICK and PINK. No smash style burger should ever look like that. The patty was cold and the bread was cold. It looks like it’s been sitting out for hours. Even the fries were cold and overly salty. I should’ve know my experience wasn’t going to end well when the cashier rudely stared at me with a blank face after my wife told her thank you. Truly disappointing and I’d recommend everyone steer very clear from this location. I still enjoy shake shack at other locations but this experience will make me take a VERY LONG break from shake shack. There’s plenty of other great burger locations that can accommodate properly and hire employees with manners"
