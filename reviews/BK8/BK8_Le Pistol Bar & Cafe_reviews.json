The burger here is out of this world— brioche bun, garlic parm aioli, tomato aleppo jam, French meunster cheese, carmelized onion, smashed patties I mean it really can’t get better and more delicious than that, it’s definitely my favorite on the menu. I come here for that homey yet chic experience and excellent place to sip a wine with a friend. Grateful this place exists!!!!"

Appetizers I recommend deviled eggs (they are different flavors each night) gruyere cheese and French onion dip on baguette rounds (total yum!) And for a sandwich...you must try the oxtail French dip WHICH IS OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! I wanted to lick the plate.\nThe staff is full of interesting young people who will engage you in conversation. They are very attentive to their clientele and quite knowledgeable about food and drinks.\nThere are activities (trivia night, jazz trio, DJ, Philosophy club). Everyone is made to be at home. I am an older woman and I always feel completely comfortable seated at the bar to eat, drink, and watch sports. Super friendly staff and clientele."

Great happy hour, delicious food, friendly bartenders, (Stephen, Isaac, Danny, etc,) gorgeous corner spot steps away from the usual “stuff to do” if you’re visiting, (botanic garden, museum, park,) and a great place to hang if you’re local. I love me a vodka martini French fry happy hour! With tip is under 20!"

The restaurant is quite intimate, with small tables, making it more suited for smaller parties.\n\nThe food was excellent! We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, which were absolutely amazing—10/10!

That says everything as that and eggs Benedict are two of my faves to try everywhere and compare.\nFirst, the grits were creamiest ever. The grilled shrimp was done perfectly, but the addition of soft, thin onion slices, bites of porkbelly, and sweet microgreens made every bite delicious. We were visiting Brooklyn, but our kids said they added Le Pistol to their top 5 now."

            "text": "Two frenchies walk into a French brunch bistro in Brooklyn, and oh la la what could possibly go wrong?!\n\nLe Pistol brunch in Brooklyn is a delightful mix of culinary excellence and cultural confusion. The food? Magnifique. The ambiance? Well, let's just say, they got some distinct French things wrong and some things very right.\n\nFirstly, the servers were way too friendly. In a true French restaurant, you expect a healthy dose of disdain with your meal. Secondly, the size of the orange juices was laughable. In France, you would get a size able OJ, but here, it was more like a shot glass.\n\nPaying $5 for half an orange seems excessive even for Brooklyn, especially as these oranges come from Orange County, they’re not even Champagne import (like us).\n\nThe breakfast toasts were a curious affair. Served deconstructed, we were essentially tasked with sandwich assembly. Perhaps the kitchen staff were channeling their inner French by making us work for our meal.\n\nHalfway through our ‘petit’ toasts, we caved and ordered pancakes, hoping they'd arrive before dinner. To our relief, they were American-sized fluffy pancakes, a stark contrast to the expected deconstructed crepes.\n\nOverall, Le Pistol gets an A+ for food and an F for French authenticity—maybe minus the long wait for the food to arrive and being included in the labor of making brunch happen. So in that sense, a little taste of home. All blagues aside, Pistolet is a solid brunch option and  who needs Paris when you've got Brooklyn?"

The salad was dressed and seasoned perfectly. I’m going to be craving that salad all summer.
