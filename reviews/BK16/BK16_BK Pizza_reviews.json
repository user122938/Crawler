There's a six-piece lunch special W/Pepsi for $6.99 and then there's the $9.99 choice for the six-piece pepperoni pizza that comes with a six-piece cheesy bread. Don't let the little man with the big eyes fool you. He's going to act like he doesn't speak nor understand english. I tried to explain to him that he charged me for the $9.99 pizza when I wanted the $6.99 joint and since he took it upon himself to charge me anyway for the $9.99 pizza, I felt entitled to get the cheesy bread. My words to him went in one ear and out the other. My words held no substance as his english was lax. I got jerked 😑"
