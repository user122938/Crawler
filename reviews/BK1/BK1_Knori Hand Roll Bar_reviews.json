Easy fix that I hope the  owners/manager make! Glad to know the place is super clean,  but the heavenly delicate fish shouldn't  be overpowered by that."

The beers are all bottle, no draft, decided to pass on that. The first nori sandwich came out and after 2 bites it was gone, the same happened to the other 4, after 15 mins I was done, and hungry. I think no normal person will be full after 5, you need about 7-8 to feel fine, but at about 60$ you might as well just go to a normal sushi restaurant. The food is good, just too small and pricey. I wont be going back."

My partner and I were celebrating, so we chose the Chef Tasting Menu which notes on the menu it comes with an appetizer, fresh fish and handrolls. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! The appetizer had an array of 3 hearty bites featuring fresh seafood. Second course was nigiri which tasted really good and were large pieces of fish. The handrolls were great quality too, and at the end of the meal my boyfriend and I left full. I recommend the counter seating, specifically the one facing the kitchen curtain (so perpendicular to the work station), because we got great views of the sushi chef!"

            "text": "Fabulous new hand roll spot in greenpoint. Service is top notch, the flavors are truly well balanced and impressive. Will most definitely be making this a regular stop in greenpoint! Best hand rolls I’ve ever tried in NYC. We had the premium sampler with scallop, kampachi (my fav), toro (second fav), salmon and snow crab (real crab). So light & refreshing. Must try! Our waiter Colby was super attentive and knowledgeable- fantastic experience overall."
