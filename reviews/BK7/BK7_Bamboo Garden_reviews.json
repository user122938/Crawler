В меню к сожалению не оказалось ни одной картинки. я хотела для себя открыть утку по-пекински в этом ресторане и показала официанту картинку из их сайта. Мы предполагали что это будет целая утка порезанная на куски. В Блюде оказалось как минимум три лапки две головы много костей не жующееся мясо, резиновая и кожа . крупно порезанные и зажаренные макароны пожалуй было единственное что было съедобным в этом блюде. Явно не было окорочков и явно не было грудок какие-то обрубки крыльев и обрубки остатки от других уток.\nХотела не оставлять типов но решила оставить немного, когда написала свою сумму то мне указали что этого недостаточно и надо добавить больше типов . По итогу заплатили более 70 $ и остались голодными. Я всё думала что брать с собой это ну так себе, но вкусно и оставлять не хочется, я первый раз поняла что не брать с собой это вообще отстой, это фиаско ребята. Не рекомендую"

Unfortunately, the woman who answered the phone was extremely rude and unprofessional.\n\nShe repeatedly interrupted me, spoke over me, and refused to let me finish my sentences. I have never encountered such poor customer service at a restaurant before. I typically don’t leave reviews, but this experience was so terrible that I felt compelled to share. I’ve dined here before, but after this incident, I have no desire to return. No customer should be treated this way, and I sincerely hope the front desk staff member who answered my call reconsiders how she speaks to customers. To make matters worse, she hung up on me saying “Im done talking to you bye.” I sincerely do not recommend this place."

The sesame balls were good it had mung bean filling instead of red bean. Cute and dainty.\n\nDimsum cart ladies are coming frequently and the space is just enough where they can come to you fairly quickly. The tables turn fast but they dont rush you. However, when you pay please prepare to go as the next group will be all up your space as servers collect table cloth for next group.\n\nBathroom is small but sink is cool, no paper towels for hand drying instead its a hand dryer.\n\nThe meats were flavorful and I like the pepper garnish that also doubles as a lil snack to pick up on:)"

The feng zhao was decent, the flavor wasn't as strong and as spicy as other ones I've had. We also had the shrimp cheong fun, ha mai cheong fun, dim sum, har gao, lava custard buns, mini egg tarts and chrysanthemum jelly. The desserts were my favorite. We didn't try anything else but it does look like they offer peking duck and buns as we saw another table order it.\n\nBy the entrance, roast meats are sold. It also looked like a lot of people can place lunch box orders there as there was a guy who placed an order for 40 lunch boxes as I was leaving."

My cousin who is receiving chemo at the office across the street wanted some to take home so I went back. I got there and got yelled at by an older man who must be the owner or management because I wanted to use Apple Pay. He as well as the male cashier lied and said they don’t accept Apple Pay even though I bought lunch there two hours earlier with guess what?? APPLE PAY! I showed them the transaction on my phone and my receipt. Not using Apple Pay is fine but don’t lie to my face. It’s condescending and rude and he was yelling for no reason.  The yelling man said no Apple Pay so I said sure I’ll come back with my card. I came right back with my card and then he said $20 minimum. If you didn’t want to serve me just say that. I couldn’t make this up. I guess he’s not used to women telling him not to yell at them. Left in disgust and disbelief. As a non Asian and I’ll even say as a black woman don’t even waste your time here. You will get yelled at and talked about."

You talk to them nicely and they don’t acknowledge you at all.  But once you get loud and start yelling, then they want to take your order.  I guess it’s the typical Chinese culture for them.  Anyway, besides that they have some very good and authentic Chinese dim sum and rice, and noodle dishes.  Their roast duck, garlic, and soy sauce chicken is also very good.  My family and I used to go there a lot for yumcha.  But lately, we just do takeout.  Still very good, but kind of pricey for dimsum, but hey, we’re having an inflation in the U.S. so everything went up!  Though their service and attitudes definitely needs improvement! 🥟🍲🍚"
