The chicken left me speechless in the worst way. I basically threw away $27. I would’ve been better off giving that money to someone in need."

Everything on the menu is consistently delicious and well-prepared, but the Munch beef-wrapped chicken tenders are easily one of my all-time favorites. Their Chinese dishes are flavorful, authentic, and always hit the spot. The restaurant has plenty of seating on the main floor, making it great for families, groups, or casual meals, and there’s even a party room available for gatherings or events. The service is friendly, and the whole experience is both comfortable and satisfying every time."

Portion sizes are big, so you definitely leave satisfied. I kicked things off with the pulled brisket tacos (beyond yum), then had the Onion Bloom — crispy, scrumptious, an absolute must-try. For the main, I went with the Hawaiian Rice Spicy, and it was packed with flavor. The dine-in vibe was really nice and comfortable too. Shout-out to Yehda who took my order — super friendly, accommodating, and made the whole experience even better. Will definitely be back!"
