The panini had a fluffy yet slight crispy texture that complemented well the pesto that was fresh and fragrant. You can never go wrong with balsamic vinegar dressing on your salad either. The fries were crunchy and had a delicious sauce that was like an aioli with a kick. OJs were so fresh and way better than whole foods’ bottled ones. Please check it out while you are around, grab a brunch and enjoy some sunshine."

JFK가기전 허기진 배를 (아침을 일찍먹고 하루종일 아무것도 못먹어) 채우고 가려고 짐을 들고 갔는데 분위기가 아주 가족적이고 편안했습니다. 치킨윙과 크림파스타 치킨샐러드 그리고 키즈밀로 치킨튀김과 프라이즈 그리고 음료수 3개 시켰는데 양이 정말 어마어마합니다 ㅎㅎ 미국이 양많이 주는 나란줄 알고 갔다 비싼가격과 적은 양에 깜짝 놀란 나에게 이 카페는 천사카페 ㅎㅎ\n팁포함 USD60을 냈는데 별거 안시켜도 40~50불 그냥 나오는 식당에 비해 정말 맛있고 든든하게 먹고 60불은 싸게 느껴졌습니다 ㅎㅎ 정말 강추하오니 써니사이드 혹은 우드사이드에 묵으심 아침 저녁으로 2번 드세요~♡"
