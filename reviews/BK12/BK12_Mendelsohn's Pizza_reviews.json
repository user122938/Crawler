Randazzo's is a better close option, Lo Duca at Newkirk Plaza even better but a bit of a walk. Service here wasn't great either, and I got a lot of dirty looks when I walked in. Cashier was abrupt and short with me (it was my first time there) and rolled his eyes when I asked if they had parmesan. I get it to an extent because I've worked in food service in New York and new customers can be annoying, but it wasn't busy and I was pretty good at figuring out how to get my food and pay but they were still unfriendly with me. It felt race-driven but what are you gonna do."

The pizza, in particular, was a symphony of flavors - a perfect harmony between the crispy, yet chewy crust and the high-quality, fresh toppings. Each bite was a testament to the chef's mastery in creating a mouthwatering sensation. The taste lingered, making me eager for my next visit.What truly elevated this experience was the impeccable service. The staff was not just courteous but also incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, offering recommendations and ensuring every need was met. Their attentiveness and genuine friendliness made the dining experience even more enjoyable.Mendelsohn's Pizza is not just a place to dine; it's an institution of culinary excellence and hospitality. It's evident that they put their heart and soul into every dish served. It's not just a meal; it's an unforgettable experience. I'll be recommending Mendelsohn's to everyone seeking not just a meal, but an exceptional dining adventure.\""

The crust is perfectly chewy, the sauce is sweet  and the cheese is melted to perfection. 🧀 The service is always friendly, and the atmosphere is exciting and inviting. The garlic knots are just out of this world !I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for delicious kosher pizza in Brooklyn!\""
