The vibes are immaculate, the flavors hit like a memory you didn’t know you missed, this is it."

Often times, it’ll arrive as a solid block and it’s nearly impossible to separate the noodles as it all sticks together like a giant hockey puck).\n\nOtherwise great food!"

The interior of this space is pretty small (only 5 seats), so you likely have to get there early to put your name down on their waitlist (that's what I did). Fortunately, the wait for me was only about 20 minutes. However, behind their restaurant, they have a speakeasy that you can grab some drinks at while you wait!\n\nThe menu here is very simple, with only a few set items. If you are looking for more of their appetizers/dishes or even their new breakfast menu(!), it is only available for to-go (although their breakfast menu is a bit different). My friend and I ordered their beef noodle soup combo and we both loved it. The set came with pickled cabbages, popcorn chicken, tea eggs, and iced tea. It was so filling, huge portion, and very comforting. Loved it and I would love to come back to try their other dishes or try their expanded to-go menu!"

They gave us some pickled tomatoes while we waited, which were delicious and refreshing. They have a separate menu for dine-in and to go. We ordered the beef noodle soup and dry noodle. The dry noodles were really good, we added an additional bowl that costs only $3 more"

I ordered the lu rou fan (braised pork rice) and it came with popcorn chicken, noodle cabbage side dish, and tea. Plenty of food for one or two share if you're not too hungry. The space is really small, but the intimacy makes it vibey. There's also a bar in the back that you can check out after you eat or while you wait to be seated. Love this spot!!"

Don't be fooled by its small size, this restaurant packs a powerful punch of genuine Taiwanese cuisine.\n\nDespite having limited counter seats and a bustling open kitchen, Gulp LIC delivers an  authentic taste experience that keeps diners coming back from more.\n\nWe sampled the beef noodle soup and the braised pork rice, and both dishes impressed with their generous portions and rich satisfying flavors.\n\nThe menu is concise, it focuses on quality and delivers on taste.\n\nService is remarkably friendly and quick, even amid the constant flow of orders.\n\nIf you prioritize authentic flavors and don't mind a cozy, bustling environment, Gulp is a must try for a quick and satisfying Taiwanese food fix in NYC."

            "text": "UPDATE 09/22/25: Management did a great job of addressing the issues I had with my order and I went back to dine-in for a late lunch. I tried the braised pork dry noodles and was thoroughly impressed with the portion size and flavor of my dish! The pork sauce was very flavorful without being salty and the chicken remained crispy the entire time. You have the option to add on a second bowl of pork noodles or a pork chop for only $3 which is a fantastic deal for the quality and quantity of the meal. The staff was attentive and kind and I was very satisfied with my in-person experience. I will definitely be back!!\n\nUsually enjoy the beef noodle soup for takeout although lately I have noticed a decline in the portion sizes of their takeout orders. On one occasion, I was only given a few measly pieces of beef which was disappointing but did not think much of it. Today, I ordered the lu ro fan to-go and received an offensively small portion of pork. It was only enough to cover the outer surface of the pile of rice and the pork pieces were exceptionally small compared to what is shown in advertisements and from dine in photos. The flavors are good, I just wish I had more to enjoy. I would like to indulge in their bigger portions in person one day but after this experience I am afraid of risking another disappointment."
