Food is incredible and Yoeli always has a smile and good word for every customer.\n\nNo one has such good pizza as Table 40 and I have never had a bad tasting food item from here and I've tried things from their soups to their fish plates to their bakery items. Top notch.\n\nClean and bright place. Good and fast service. Great variety and excellent selection. Hot foods, cold foods, specialty drinks and bottled drinks. Some great delectable dessert options."

Pizza and all the rest of the food is fresh, piping hot, and absolutely delicious. Customer service is good, the employees are always looking for ways to assist the customers to the fullest extent. Located on 13th Ave. So parking will always be an issue, try walking there instead, it's definitely a better option than searching for parking in that neighborhood. Overall, it's really a spectacular place, would definitely recommend others to come visit and see for themselves this delicious kosher pizza shop."
