I stood at the counter for over five minutes, completely ignored by the staff, even though the place was practically empty. The wait for food was even worse—it took a shocking 18 minutes to get a simple order ready, and then even longer for a single cappuccino.\nThe state of this place is disgusting. The tables were visibly dirty despite there being no other customers. And don't even get me started on the bathroom—it was full of roaches, and there was no paper towel or air dryer. The food was just \"okay,\" but it's not worth the horrific experience.\nThis place is a complete disaster. Save yourself the trouble and money and go anywhere else. Yuck!"

Two of the smoothies didn’t have the adjustments u made but they kindly remade it and were very kind and welcoming. This was a great quick smoothie place while we did our laundry. The seating was comfortable and the atmosphere were very relaxing and chill. I don’t ever rite reviews but they were very kind in correcting my order so I felt that the least I could do to appreciate was write a review of my experience, can’t wait to see this place flourish more as u see they have a another food area in the back that is a work in progress still, btw the smoothies were really good and refreshing thank you"
