The environment is fast-paced, energetic, and fun — exactly what you’d expect from a company that values both its guests and employees. One of the things I appreciate most is the strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie among staff.\n\nManagement is supportive, approachable, and genuinely invested in helping team members grow. I especially love working with Kiwi and her management team — I’ve never had a group of leaders who are so down to earth and genuinely want to help others succeed. They lead with heart, and it shows in how they treat both the team and the guests.\n\nAnother huge plus is how flexible they are with scheduling. They really work with my availability, which makes it so much easier to balance work with life outside the restaurant.\n\nWhether you’re just starting out or looking to build a long-term career, Texas Roadhouse is a great place to be."

            "text": "Texas Roadhouse is a solid choice when you're craving a hearty meal and a casual, lively atmosphere. The highlight for me is definitely the fresh rolls with cinnamon butter—they’re served warm and are easily one of the best parts of the experience.\n\nThe steaks are generally well-cooked and flavorful, though depending on the day, the consistency can vary a bit. When they get it right, it’s hard to beat for the price. The ribs and grilled meats are also good—tender, smoky, and satisfying.\nThe sides are decent overall. Although my go to choices are usually the mashed potatoes and the drained corn.\n\nService is usually friendly and fast, though when it's busy, expect to wait quite a while to be seated. That said, the staff generally tries to keep things moving and make sure you’re taken care of.\n\nOverall, it’s not fine dining, but it delivers on what it promises: a fun, filling, and affordable meal in a comfortable setting. If you go in with those expectations, you’ll likely walk out full and happy."

I have ordered door dash before but that's a different experience. I highly suggest going in to sit and enjoy your meal. I first went to Chili's, I walked out due to lack of service and unable to get my drink order correct. Came here, I guess I had the look of confused cause they knew immediately I hadn't been there before 😅 They gave me a thank you gift. So glad I came, very friendly service. Very attentive service, my drink never got under half! The food was amazing! Five stars 🌟 and I never give out 5!"

All the food menu its really good i can say that i have try all the menu and everything its really good. My only bad comment it will be on the restrooms. Boys restrooms are really bad no cleaning, water or pee all over the floor slippery floors and i don’t see someone taking care of. Thats every time you go to roadhouse always the same. Even smells bad."

Yet $21.00 for this small 8oz. Was NOT WORTH THE MONEY. They did everything in such a hurry that when they came back, my shrimp were cold, so I could not enjoy a well cooked hot meal. I was just disappointed that I left it behind and was not even going to bother. But I won't order it again.\n\nI was pretty impressed with the pull pork, not to shabby. Nor to dry yet moist enough and  well served and got full. Not to mention, I requested that the cooked Jalapenos add that extra taste. I'm not a fan of the sauce they give you, so I ate it mixed in my baked potato and was very good. My sides were the baked potato normal butter and sour cream and corn. I will order this once again when I go back. Thank you, Texas Roadhouse, or should I say the cook!."
