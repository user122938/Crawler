Pizza with arugula & prosciutto and hot & sweet calamari for appetizers were so good we all were saying we kind of wished we didn't order entrees so we could double up on the apps.  Dinners didn't disappoint,  flounder oreganata fresh & tasty no overwhelming garlic taste which happens with oreganata,  pasta puttanesca was wow, porkchop delish, bolognese yum- every dish was a home run. House pinot grigio was very good,  coconut creme brulee was to die for. Service was terrific and the restaurant small and unassuming but really i put it above my all time favorite neighborhood spot ginos."

I asked for linguini with my clams instead of spaghetti, but still got spaghetti. That said, the food was tasty, the company was great and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The \"off \" orders were not significant enough to ruin our experience. Oh yeah, they put caramel sauce on the plate under my cannoli.  Try it, the food is good and staff very friendly.

The minute this post-pig landed on my table, I felt something in my heart stir. The juices swirled as the scent of porkchop-perfection filled the air. Excited, I eagerly cut open the tender meat to discover a rich pink sear on the inside. Expectations high, I took my first bite. Instantly, I experienced a whole array of taste I never knew was possible, each chew releasing a new explosion of flavor. I sat there, stunned, never having known such food induced pleasure was possible. I couldn't possibly bear to keep The Chop to myself, and one by one, introduced it to each of my colleagues. They too fell helpless victim to its sheer deliciousness, proclaiming it \"the best piece of meat I've ever eaten\" and \"a bite for the ages.\" As a harsh food connoisseur, I have never given a food a 10/10, and that won't change today. The Chop could never be rated on a human scale, being inhuman in nature. The Chop could only have been fabricated by something otherworldly; a pig treated like a holy relic, fed only the finest foods in elephantine proportions. Without question, the best food to ever happen to me. Head down to Annabelles Pastaria to get your very own porkchop experience today"

Their food was pretty good, but that is the only positive of my experience. My date and I waited an hour and a half for our appetizer. We had a 6:00pm reservation and when we arrived, there were 2 other couples there, so to wait an hour and a half for an appetizer was ridiculous. I’m not sure if they were low on staff but they should have prioritized their customers dining in person. There were a lot of delivery service orders being processed and that took time away from satisfying their customers in house."

The chicken franchese was very tough my wife sent it back they gave her a new one but that also was very tough. We didn’t say anything. My veal parm  meal was also very thick and tough again I didn’t complain.

There is a lunch menu but rather than having wraps or paninis we wanted to try their pasta dishes. I haven't had a good pesto dish in a while and their bucatini pesto was delicious. After eating this the pear ravioli was like dessert.  Clean restrooms. Restaurant is away from the 86th street foot and bus traffic. Worth walking a few blocks away from the shopping district."

I got the tagliatelle Maria with grilled chicken (fresh pasta made daily).They cut the chicken up and mixed it with the pasta which was amazing compared to just putting sliced grilled chicken on top. The sweet and spicy calamari is different and delicious. Their standard grandma style pizza is very good as well. The setting is very a comfy NYC Italian vibe. The service is top notch as well. Courteous and attentive staff that suites the quality of food provided. Great date spot or family dinner. They also have more items on the menu than the website menu shows. Definitely will be coming back."

It didn't taste bad, it just didn't taste like any tiramisu I've ever had. Like if someone had just handed it to me and told me to try it I don't think I'd know what it was supposed to be. It doesn't even really look like tiramisu (pic is from their Seamless). I even googled \"traditional Tiramisu recipe\" because I know Italian food in America tends not to actually be authentic but none of the results resembled what I got from this place. Barely any cocoa powder and if there was any espresso in it I couldn't taste it. Anyway I'm not saying you shouldn't eat here, just don't order the tiramisu if you do."

The chicken parmigiana, grilled chicken with broccoli robe, and mushroom lasagna were all expertly prepared and absolutely delicious. Christine, the owner, was a pleasure to speak with and her passion for her restaurant was evident in the quality of the food. As an independently owned and operated establishment, this restaurant truly stands out. Our server, Tiffany, was also amazing and added to the overall enjoyable dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine and top-notch service. You’ll feel just at home here!"
