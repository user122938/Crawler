Iv let the waiter know that it's not true iv tipped based on service provided. I regret giving higher tip event though I wasn't deserved, very entited male waiter.

The water keeps flowing and the staff loves to give recommendations if you need it.\n\nThe food is always fresh and flavorful. There's a reason they made 200,000 monkey rolls in the last 18 years. You'll want to get 2 at least.\n\nLastly, the price range is great. Especially when compared to the overpriced locations of Manhattan.\n\nDon't miss out on Iron Chef."

The salmon roll was great, salmon tasted super fresh and was very flavorful. Their salmon roll includes cucumber as well and has the rice wrapped around the outside of the roll, however this was a welcome change. Next up the California roll. The Cali roll was also very good and hugely filling, the avocado slices were a little on the bigger side and made for a nice bite. Lastly the spicy crab/shrimp roll, my least favorite of the bunch but still relatively good, shrimp flavor was lacking and would've loved it to been a bit spicier but a good roll nonetheless. The rice on all the rolls was well prepared, nice and chewy and overall very solid sushi for the price ~$13. Will have to come back to try the rest of their rolls another time."
