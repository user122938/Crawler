We tried Tom Kha Soup, Zab Wings (just like the original KFC in Thailand!), Thai Curry Puff, Whole Fried Fish with Ginger Sauce, Crab Fried Rice, and Spicy Bamboo Chicken — every dish was amazing. The Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee were perfectly sweet. The staff and owner were very friendly, not just to us but to all the customers while we were there. You can really feel the warmth and care in both the food and the service. Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood Thai spots!"

You must get a drink - they can make any of them a mocktail and they were super refreshing! The Thai Iced Tea was also the right amount of sweetness.\n- Pad Woon Sen: A yummy rice noodle dish that has a bit of everything.\n- Zab Wings: Really tasty coating on the wings! Not spicy at all.\n- Mango Sticky Rice: Classic Thai dessert AND super affordable here ($8)!!\n- Tom Kha Soup: Surprisingly really delish and a nice change from Tom Yum. It's a homey coconut milk-based soup!\n- Roti Massaman: Another classic Thai dish that's perfect for sharing. You can't go wrong.\nOverall, everything we got was very good and affordable priced. The hospitality is the BEST as well! The owner, Amy, also stopped to chat with us and she was so sweet. I'd definitely come back!"

I ordered the dragon fruit colada which was too thick for my liking.

            "text": "I was highly impressed with this spot! Im in from out of town and I loved the food here. We ordered the papaya salad, gyoza, pad see ew, and eggplant basil and all of the above were BOMB. Me and my friend who lives here, basically licked our plates clean. I have had a lot of thai food, including in Thailand and this is very authentic Thai food! The servers and kitchen staff were ON IT! We barely waited 5 minutes for our first appetizer and then the dishes kept coming in perfect timing. I appreciate that they brought things out as they were ready and HOT. Everything was cooked perfectly. It was comfortable seating arrangements. The servers were very kind and welcoming, especially Natcha who served us. She is beautiful on the inside and out and connected with me about Thailand. She even treated us to a mango sticky rice which was also DELICIOUS. Even though we were so full, we still made room for dessert! I would highly recommend this place and I will come back next time I'm in town. Ca poon ca!"

They moved tables to allow us a comfortable section and were so accommodating of our little ones. Food came out for the kids quickly as requested and they had special kid plates and adorable silverware for them. Everyone was thrilled with their food. The tamarind duck was the star! The staff was so kind and caring. Overall such a lovely spot!"

Mango punch was refreshing and had a refreshing bite to it.\n\nService was standard. Had to ask for water. One of the orders was messed up, but it tasted okay so chose to eat it anyway.\n\nAtmosphere: cute little place. Good lighting with windows. Modern look with mirrors and seating. Pleasant background noise."

            "text": "If you're looking for an authentic taste of Thailand right in your own city, look no further than this amazing Thai restaurant. From the moment you step through the door, you’re transported to Thailand with a vibrant atmosphere that sets the stage for an unforgettable dining experience. The flavors are truly the closest you can get to the real deal outside of Thailand itself — every dish bursts with the right balance of spice, sweetness, and tanginess, just like the food you'd savor in a bustling Thai market.\nWhat really sets this place apart, though, is the exceptional service. Even though the restaurant includes tips in their policy, you’d never guess it from the level of attentiveness and care the staff provides. They go above and beyond to make every guest feel welcome, offering personalized recommendations and making sure each meal is perfect. The staff’s attention to detail is extraordinary. They take notes of a special event we were celebrating and made us feel like royalty with thoughtful touches throughout our visit.\nWe left the restaurant feeling incredibly special and happy, having experienced not only the best Thai food but also an unparalleled level of service that made the entire experience one to remember. This restaurant truly nails both the flavors of Thailand and the art of hospitality. Highly recommend! ❤️\nLove Mimi"

            "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nI had such a wonderful experience at Amy’s Thai Bistro in Brooklyn! We started with the spring rolls, which were perfectly crispy and flavorful — the ideal appetizer. I ordered the beef Pad See Ew for my main course, and it was absolutely delicious — tender beef, fresh veggies, and just the right balance of sweet and savory. The mango and strawberry margarita was refreshing and vibrant, pairing beautifully with the meal.\n\nFor dessert, the fried ice cream was a perfect finish — crispy on the outside, creamy and cold inside. The service was fantastic from start to finish — attentive, friendly, and welcoming. We even got to meet Amy herself, which made the experience feel extra special. You can really tell she cares about her food and her customers. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for fresh, flavorful Thai food in Brooklyn!"
