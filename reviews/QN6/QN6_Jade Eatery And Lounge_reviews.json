The black seared tuna was excellent sushi grade fish and well worth the price for the portion size but the fish in the rainbow roll, tuna tartare, and spicy tuna crispy rice was just awful. Somehow we racked up a bill of 100$ (for just 2 people) and I was still hungry after the fact because it was practically inedible the way it reeked. Yes I am picky so bear that in mind but it was very disappointing to pay such prices for such FISHY fish. Disgusting. Literally made me sick to my stomach.\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong thing but in such a nice place I had high hopes that the fish would be good.\n\nOtherwise the drinks were well worth the price 👌"

Inside is a classy restaurant with lots of decor and good photo opportunities.\n\nWe started out with a Thai iced tea and a passionfruit berry mocktail, both of which were delicious. We went straight to ordering entrées. We ordered the Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Malai Boti and Hakka noodles (veg).\n\nThe chicken Manchurian is spicy, be warned. However, it was extremely flavorful and sautéed in sauce with stir-fried vegetables. The vegetarian noodles were also quite delicious, mild in spice, and were a good accompaniment to the chicken. To try something different, we ordered the Malai Boti for more of a Pakistani flair. The chicken was grilled perfectly and was served with a tangy green chutney. Portion sizes here are generous for the price.\n\nOverall: 9/10"

My friends and I go often for the $18 lunch which is amazing. I however haven’t had the entrees as I am obsessed with small plates like yellowfin tuna, king crab Rangoon and soup that they have.\n\nWent on a Saturday evening, had a party of 10. My waitress was just all over the place, I get it, it’s busy, but I had to constantly ask for her to come back to place drink and food orders for my table. Keep in mind we spent almost 2k there so this was disappointing. Drinks were strong, Asian pear hits the spot everytime. Apps were awesome as usual and sushi was great.\n\nBecause they have the windows open we encountered small nats at our table, a puddle of water on floor that was never cleaned up before we even arrived and dead/broken iPads to use for menu ordering. My two friends who did order entree’s didn’t enjoy it but most did, I would say the night was hit or miss.\n\nDesserts? 2/10, Jade please revisit the desserts - I BEG. I don’t know if they just take them out of the freezer or what but maybe a pastry chef is needed as the desserts are just not great.\n\nI also had an issue with the lady at the front handling checks. She told me checks couldn’t be split even though I called in advance and asked if they could be - I was told yes. She argued with me until I asked for a manager, the manager then helped me with the check and was great.\n\nI’ll be back because I do enjoy the yellowtail and apps and drinks - 10/10 there, but there is so much room for improvement and I’m sad it missed the mark on my birthday. I would have also appreciated music to be louder by the pond area. Up by the bar is great. We didn’t hear anything down below."

Out steam dumplings were very dry and noticeably filled with pan fried ground beef with minimal flavor. We only tried one and left the rest but couldn’t swap or remove from the bill.

As far as food goes, the menu offers so many diverse options. The food did not disappoint and neither did the service. Our server was Yang and she was so sweet. She took the time to answer any questions we had when we were deciding to order, and overall was such a nice conversationalist. She as well as the other staff made our experience very swift and enjoyable. Definitely recommend going."

The staff were not as attentive or supportive considering it was a birthday dinner. Overall the service was not the best, and is truly saddening since the other two times I came the food and service was great.\n\nUPDATE: I emailed them, they never replied, never offered a refund or anything like that. Don’t come here. Thanks!"

Menus were on uncharged iPads, they ran out so we used our phones. The sesame chicken was 8/10. Chicken satay, mediocre 6/10. Basil fried rice w shrimp, medicore 7/10. Lychee martini 9/10. Crispy Thai skirt steak medium well, great pick 9/10. Lollipop chicken 7/10, regular fried chicken but the sauce was great. I would recommend to go on a weekday or weekend day due to the traffic. Zero parking In the area due to private residences, you will be walking or definitely getting a ticket/boot."

For those that are attempting to eat family style, the portions are on the smaller side. Food presentations on all the dishes were amazing. Each dish packed flavor and tasted great.\n\nThe overall price was on the higher end, but considering the location and quality of food, justified.\n\nBonus: Dishes are Halal!"

Sonam really went the extra mile to make us feel at home.\n\nFood: Every dish hit the spot, and the menu had plenty to choose from. We didn’t have to wait long, either.\n\nVibes & Decor: The place looks awesome—really upscale and stylish without being stuffy. Perfect for a special night out or just a chill dinner with friends.\n\nHalal-Friendly: Bonus points for being halal, which we really appreciate.\n\nAll in all, we totally recommend Jade Eatery.

The lighting is soft and inviting, and the decor gives off a warm, modern vibe that makes you feel right at home. Whether you're there for a casual meal or a special occasion, the atmosphere never disappoints.  My favorite part of the meal was the Lava Cake dessert – it’s a must-try! Rich, warm, and oozing with warm and smooth chocolate, it’s the perfect way to end any meal. Paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it’s the perfect pallet cleanser and sweet tooth fulfiller.  Highly recommend this spot for both the vibe and the incredible food.  You can come here with family, with friends, or even a date and you wouldn’t be upset.  All in all, great experience and would come back for sure🙌🏾"

It’s rare to find that level of hospitality these days, and it truly made the evening special."
