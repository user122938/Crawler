Even though it is convenient to eat there after church but i dont think i will go to that ihop again because the food is about the same at all locations. please spend some funds on better coffee since now you are charging $4.50 for it."

She brought my veggie omelet out first so it wouldn’t get cold while waiting for the other order  I’ve never had a server be so thoughtful! She also brought extra napkins  without us even asking, kept our coffee topped off, and even asked if we wanted to take our leftover coffee to go (a first for me!). On top of that, she made sure we had water to take with us when we left.\n\nAndrea’s attention to detail and genuine care made our visit extra special. The IHOP is always good, but Andrea made it outstanding. She truly deserves employee of the month."

I can’t make this up how do you confuse, strawberry cheesecake pancakes with banana zoster? Please tell me how. They refused a refund after they made that mistake twice. I’m tired of this . Hopefully I get my money back."

Where was my folded menu with the colorful pictures that opened my appetite that made me feel I could eat everything on that menu I felt confused lost i could not decide and because of that Miss Lashanti had to keep coming back but always with a friendly smile and a heart that felt it was made up of patient just for me to decide I got my Swedish crepe and ex large tea everything was ok but I really miss that folded menu. Ok so the food is still delicious, the inside was clean even the bathroom and sink area there are 2 toilet in the women's bathroom but they have a 2 seater if you have to wait just outside. We will be back in the future I really love going to IHOP and this location might end up being my favorite location."

I've went about 6 times because i give places a few chances but only once did i have a good server, i dont remember her name but yes she was young but did well and carried herself well (light skin with glasses). Any other time i had to get the manager to service me. often you get seated and then forgotten about for a good 25 min before someone comes and checks on you (if they even come and check, ive had to get up myself n go to the manager and then he would take my order) and even when its dead somehow your food comes out cold. 6/6 times ive went the food was always cold and had to get sent back. Presentation goes a long way too, workers walking around with Bonnets and Durags is not professional... Also ladies stop trying to force edges, the install was poor get some of ya money back."

Gotta do better with the service, a warm greeting isn’t enough.\nUpdate-\nStill long wait for food every time I come it’s crazy I feel bad for the employees because they have to be impacted by bad reviews. This time though the manager there the entire time and did nothing to speed up the abnormally long wait and was terribly rude told me to not come if I have an issue with the wait.
