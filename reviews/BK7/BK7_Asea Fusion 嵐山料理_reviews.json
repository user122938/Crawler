The special rolls are just ok. The dumplings are just ok, and they brought us the wrong kind (we ordered veggie and they brought seafood). The one good thing was the sushi appetizer - an avocado bowl sort of thing with sashimi chunks inside.\nThe service was very slow and inattentive. I had to ask more than once for things. The staff kept apologizing and brought us a free appetizer because the service was so slow.\nI would say that the atmosphere was good but they had the low-class giant TVs on behind the sushi bar - distracting and unavoidable to the eyes from anywhere in the restaurant unless you and all your dining companions sit on one side of the table. facing away from the sushi bar, which is uncomfortable for conversation. Also I like to face the sushi bar and watch the chefs work - it's a big part of the fun of eating sushi. With a little bit of effort this place could be great. Maybe it used to be - I don't know.\nFinally, I will never, ever give 5 stars to a restaurant which has you pay the bill on a tablet and has the tip amounts listed as starting at 18%. 15% is the correct tip for satisfactory service in a restaurant. The software-based up-sell to 18% is offensive.\nThe service here was way less than satisfactory, yet I'm supposed to leave 18%? Not a chance. Bring me a paper receipt and let me calculate my own tip..."

Tuna and salmon pieces are barely even bite sized 👎\n\nAnd now the shrimp tempura, $9 for 2 pieces of thinnnn thin little shrimp, and it’s not even deveined ? 🤢\n\nNo thanks"

We decided to try Asea Fusion, known for its sashimi, sushi, and creative dishes. The open kitchen was a highlight—you can watch the chefs work with fresh ingredients, giving it an omakase-like vibe. It was such a satisfying experience!\n\n🌟 Must-Try Dishes\n1️⃣ Asea Sashimi: A luxurious nine-grid sashimi platter. Each section was a delight! The standout items were the gold-flaked uni oyster and the quail egg with caviar in the center—super fresh and packed with flavor.\n2️⃣ Yellowtail App: Thinly sliced yellowtail with a special sauce. It melts in your mouth and tastes even better with the sauce.\n3️⃣ Asea Toro App: Thick-cut tuna belly, rich and fatty. A perfect starter.\n4️⃣ Korean BBQ Beef Short Ribs: Tender and juicy short ribs with a hint of Korean BBQ sweetness. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\n5️⃣ Pyramid: A crispy and flavorful snack, perfect as a pairing with drinks.\n6️⃣ Hot Sake (Large): A must-have for a cold winter evening in NYC. Enjoying this warm sake with friends was heartwarming and perfectly complemented the fresh dishes.\n\n🍣 Summary:\nThe ingredients here are incredibly fresh, and every dish is beautifully plated, rivaling omakase standards. The nine-grid sashimi platter was especially impressive, offering a visual and culinary treat. Whether you’re here for a gathering, a date, or dining solo, this spot is a fantastic choice. Highly recommend checking it out!"

We've known this restaurant for both their sashimis and main dishes, but an exchange of chefs have only elevated this restaurant even more. You'd imagine that the fatty tuna, along with the beef liver, wouldn't be exuding a great scent. Not only does it have a great scent, the rice today harmonized with the fish itself. The clam soup could've never been better, with every one of my family members claiming it as their favorite dish of the day. All this to say, this place is a must try. After eating at so many Asian fusion restaurants, this return has made my next the more anticipated."
