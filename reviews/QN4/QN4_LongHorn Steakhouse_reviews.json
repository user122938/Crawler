The butter was not soft enough to spread on the bread comfortably and the Caesar salad tasted like the prepared types in the grocery store. Outback supersedes Longhorn by miles."

Why the hostess did this to me has reasons beyond my understanding! I had to leave as I cannot spend any more time, all this non sense waiting has already delayed my evening activities."

However, the Queen’s location was a different experience altogether. The greeters at the door weren’t attentive. I order as an appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms and entrée the Longhorn ribeye  with bone, the corn and brussels sprouts. The food was too salty, Especially the corn and the mushrooms. My steak was overcooked. I asked for medium steak and received well done. If that wasn’t bad enough, the manager tried to argue me down and said, you asked for medium well. To make matters worse they didn’t even have a glass for my drink.  They gave me a margarita, mixer, and a shot glass. Never again!  And the bathroom was disgusting!"

On the website, they have a option to join the wait list, so when we arrived at 630pm on a Saturday night, no wait whatsoever, right to a booth table. The service was great, took drink order, brought us a warmed bread with butter, and a huge Salad, both delicious. If you're prior Military like me, ask them for your 10% off discount. Our Steaks did not disappoint, cooked perfectly. Overall, we enjoyed our meal 😋. They have a parking lot, but the earlier you go the better for getting a spot. It's a congested area, because they're multiple other restaurants nearby. Definitely would go again."

I swear this is why I don’t go to places that have lower than a 4.5 rating, my friend wanted to go so bad because she liked “long horn” in the south… Mind you 9/10 food in the south tastes better than food in NY. Even the waiter kept disappearing, had to keep asking other waiters. I swear just a waste of time going there. Hopefully they improve, but it’s a never again for me.

I requested for an additional garlic butter to try to help the flavor, but it still did not taste good. My best friend had a cheeseburger with fries that did not have enough flavor.  I’m not sure if they have a change in cook, but whoever made the food yesterday it did not taste good they need to go back to culinary school. I always go to this restaurant with my family and never have a problem but yesterday food was horrible and the service that we received wasn’t too great either possibly that the young lady was tired or she had too many tables to look out for that could be a bit overwhelming"

Of course she ordered a steak abd I ordered the salmon dinner and let me tell you.  This was the best salmon I had. It just melted it my mouth and was flavored. My girlfriend stated that her steaj was so good, it was the second best strak she has had in her life. I'm definitely going back and I will upload pictures. But this is a must place to eat, worth every penny."

They never came with any so my date had to walk over to the bar and ask smh. My appetizers came out and I had to ask for appetizer plates. I couldn't get the iced tea I wanted. They ran out. They didn't have any of the long pour glasses for my margarita so they put it in a regular glass. The drink had no liquor. Sent it back. Got another drink. And had to pay for both. My food... my salmon was way overcooked. I couldn't eat it and my mash potatoes were cold. At this point I packed up paid and left"

After shortly being seated, our server came over with our menu. Looking around, the floor was dirty, and the little light lamps by our table had a bunch of dust hanging. Definitely, this restaurant needs some cleaning done. On to the menu, there is a nice variety of foods to choose from for your main dish. For drinks, we ordered  a corona and a frozen strawberry margarita. Margarita was served in a big glass. Margarita was tasty and strong. For appetizers, we ordered the seasoned steak house wings, which is served with blue cheese dressing and a side of buffalo sauce. Wings were super flavorful on their own without the buffalo sauce. Wings were nice and crispy and seasoned very well. I loved the chunky blue cheese dressing. Now on to our main course. We ordered the 6 oz. Renegade Sirloin & 8 ct. Redrock Grilled Shrimp. That order comes with two side dishes, I ordered a side of Caesar salad and loaded baked potato. We ordered New York Strip* 12 oz with a side order of steakhouse mac & cheese and fire- grill corn on the cob. Caesar salad was good they put just the right amount of dressing on it. When my renegade sirloin meal came out, I  immediately saw they served my meal with the wrong side options. Instead of the loaded baked potato, it was served with a bunch of asparagus, seasoned rice pilaf, and a whole side bowl of crispy brussels sprouts. I told our server that it's not the side dishes I had ordered. He looked a bit confused and said, \"No worries, it's on the house, and he would get me my loaded baked potato.\" Here's the thing that gets to me, just because a server says oh the incorrect food plated is on the house does not mean that the customer automatically is happy.\" Our server could have easily taken back my food and served it correctly. When you see a bunch of side dishes that you don't eat plated on your dish, you sort of lose your appetite.  I really did not get to enjoy this meal. Steak was tough and overcooked. It was well done instead of medium well as I requested, but then again, I was served someone else's food. The only thing I enjoyed were the shrimps. Now, onto my boyfriends meal, the New York Strip, the steak was more juicer, giving it's a better cut of the steak. I was not a fan of the mac and cheese. The corn was descent. It pains me to have to write reviews like this. I honestly was looking forward to enjoying my meal given that this was our first time ever at a LongHorn Steakhouse. But between the dirty floors, dusty light lamps and incorrect food served to us we were disappointed."

Otherwise cooked well and tasty. No gravy for mashed potatoes, no bread. Soups are good. Overall, there are better options for price."

            "text": "Hands down, the best steak I’ve had in a while! The flavors and tenderness were absolutely spot on, and you can tell the quality of the meat is top-notch. My partner swears by the ribeye and raves about it every time. As for me, I can’t get enough of the steak salad—it’s a perfect blend of fresh and savory with a side of sweet potato that really completes the meal. A true “chef’s kiss” finish for both of us. Highly recommend if you’re looking for an unforgettable steak experience!"

For a Friday night 8p the waiting time was only 20 min for  9 people. I was amazed.   We had appetizers chicken wings which we asked light seasoning. It was good  not salty for us. Chicken bite was good and crispy. The wild wild shrimp was not crispy though on the soggy side.  The spinach dip great with the pita chips oh that was delicious.  Even my 3 yrs old grandson like the chips. I tried the lamb chop well done it was great it has a sweet taste sauce , tender. I was told it’s there until May 1 on the menu . I’m not sorry for trying it.  All what we ordered was delicious . Restaurant is in the mall."

            "text": "I go out to eat frequently and I don't think I've ever written a bad review in my life but this experience was genuinely intolerable. To get a full picture, my family of 4 went out to celebrate my birthday, I won't comment on the wait time bc i'm assuming they were short staffed so waiting wasn't a big issue to me. We all are busy individuals so we were ecstatic to spend time together (Therefore in great moods). We waited at the bar and ordered some drinks, bartender was friendly. When we got seated our server was Adrianna. She gave us menus and some time to look over them while my dad paid the bill at the bar. She comes back and as we start to order and the entire time it was an uncomfortable experience due to her blunt demeanor, cutting my brother off while he was trying to order his food (guess she wanted to start with drinks, then entree) perhaps she was in a rush, no problem. We brushed off her tone. When my dad asks for a salad she says \"whats your entree\" he replies with \"what do you recommend?\" She replies with \"I can't tell you what to eat.\" Then he asks \"Whats popular here?\" She replies \"Did you look at the menu?\" & \"I can come back\" I interject and explain he just wants a recommendation of whats good. (I don't want to type the entire dialogue but it didn't get much better.) Anyways, I wish I could convey the tone in which she spoke to my family. Shortly after the interaction all of our moods were ruined so we just decided to tell them we'll take our orders to go, pay the bill, and leave. Also when I asked another waiter helping us if I could have some steak sauce to go he said they didn't have that, so I asked if I could get some steak sauce in a to go container instead, which he replied \"I'll see what I can do\" What kind of steak house doesn't have some steak sauce? What a poor representation of this establishment overall and what a terrible experience of service. Will not be returning. Wish I could get back my limited family time, and $190 wasted. We still tipped because maybe she was having an off day. Hope someone working there sees this and they're able to reflect on the service they provide because to upset my entire family on my birthday and have me sitting here writing this long review should speak volume. Thanks."

Cheesy mushrooms were fresh and had an explosive flavor along with the mash potatoes. Portions are generous and wait times are favorable.\n\nOverall a great steakhouse option with classic dishes and good service. Decor is a bit dated."

            "text": "Came in around 3pm on a Monday with my partner. It was our first time dining in so we were very excited to experience Longhorn.\n\nWe had a sweet waitress by the name of Rosa, she did a magnificent job. Very warm energy and patient when explaining the menu and reading back our orders. She even didn’t have any issue helping me use the gift cards I had for the meal. Just for the service alone, I would be back.\n\nNow let’s get into the meat and potatoes 😂\nThe bread is delicious! They serve it with a whipped butter. My wife and I decided to go with the seasoned wings for an appetizer. Great choice! It came with an selection of sauces. Big beautiful wings & fried to perfection. My wife likes them a lot! I felt they were more on the saltier side but I think sugar is salty so ignore my tastebuds lol.\n\nWe both decided to get a sirloin cut and man, we weren’t disappointed! Smooth and buttery!! I had mines medium well as my wife had hers medium. She had the sweet potato, I chose the crispy Brussels sprouts. We went to townnn!!\n\nDefinitely give ‘em a try and see what’s going on here. We definitely will be back for the happy hour. I think we just found our new fave spot 😉"

However, the wait times can get really long, so maybe it’s time to consider opening another location nearby 🥹.\n\nThat being said, the bathrooms seriously need more attention. They’re often extremely dirty and unpleasant, which really takes away from the overall experience. Please clean them more frequently!"
