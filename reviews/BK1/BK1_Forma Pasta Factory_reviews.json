            "text": "Has one of the best meals in my time in New York here. Delicious food that use classic flavours and seasonal ingredients. Short menu with a good delesection.\n\nWe got the scampi, the vegetable lasagna and the broccolini, and they served us two complimentary portions of foccasia. The scampi was abundant, the lasagna had robust and the broccolini was bright. All three dishes were perfectly cooked and had amazing depth of flavour without being too rich and heavy, with no cream used. The broccolini was bright and acidic with sweet, caramelised onions and garlic.\n\nLoved it and cannot wait to eat here again. The place was casual and we sat outside. The service was quick, accommodating and polite."

I’ve never had such a strong or prolonged reaction to food before, which leads me to believe there may have been an issue with how the meat was prepared or handled in the kitchen.\n\nIt’s incredibly disappointing, especially given how excited I was to try this place.

I’ve also come in the past and ordered the Pipette Ragu ($14) and Fettuccine Funghi ($14). All the pasta I tried were cooked well, had amazing toppings, and delicious. My favorite was the ragu, but the fettuccine and bolognese are close seconds. The Friday special was good too, but was not as flavorful.

Imagine if milk bread was Italian... so plush and scrumptious.\nFor a small place, the ambiance is soo nice. So much natural light in a tucked away seating area in the back. Clean as can be.\nService makes this place though. Shout out the owner who must keep their employees very happy because the energy in this place set the tone for my day. I was like sad to leave because I was having so much fun and felt so much joy eating there and being taken care of in a genuine way.\nForgot to snag a pic but their tirimisu is also made in house and is impeccable.
