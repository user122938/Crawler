Customers should never be punished for not finishing their food, and to add insult to injury, this charge was not disclosed anywhere on the menu or before we asked for boxes.\n\nIf you want to talk about poor customer service and lack of transparency, this is it. Charging people extra to take home food they already paid for is disgusting and borderline illegal. I’ve supported many local businesses in Ridgewood, but this kind of behavior gives the entire neighborhood a bad name.\n\nSuper Pollo, do better."

That’s just the way I like to move idk.\n\nMy destination was Super Pollo in Ridgewood, as it is the most recommended chicken spot in my comments and DMs that I have yet to hit.\n\nAfter 9 stops and a brisk 13 minute walk, I arrived at the promised land. I got this tingly feeling when I saw a Smart Car wrapped in Super Pollo branding. “Super Pollo” was written in bold yellow lettering and there was an animated chicken with “SP” on his chest like a superhero. I’m really not a car guy, but this is my dream whip. Legendary.\n\nI walked in and got a table for 1 like a nerd loser, but these chicken reviews tend to be a solitary practice. I feel Van Gogh.\n\nI got the half chicken and 2 sides combo ($17) and a side of maduros ($6) for the city. On the surface, this chicken looked like one of the greats. The skin was perfectly golden brown and so crispy. It crackled when I touched it with my fork.\n\nHowever, I got trojan-horsed a bit. The bird itself was just a bit dry. It wasn’t so dry where it was killing me, but compared to the greats, it just didn’t have the same tender juicy meat. The green sauce was AMAZING and made it to die for, but you must judge a chicken pre sauce. Otherwise we are just judging sauce.\n\nIt was very well seasoned though and had so much flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, and it’s still in my A-tier ranking for chicken spots. I’m just a rotisserie chicken snob at this point. 8.7/10.\n\nIf I lived anywhere near here, I’d be coming at least 3 times a week. Nothing better after a good workout than pollo a la brasa.\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov__"

Understandable, unfortunately the manager is incredibly rude. I asked if I could have a fish burrito, and he said “NO! NO WE DONT DO THAT! NO, NO” with no recommendation or anything. When I asked if I can just avec the burrito with no meat then, same response. Ok.\nBut then the person I was eating with ordered a rotisserie chicken and a side of guacamole to this manager. He said ok, then I saw him send another server back to us to tell us no we can’t get a side of guacamole. Only guacamole WITH tostones or WITH chips. Weird inflexibility again, so we got the tostones.\n\n#2 We make tostones all the time and have them at several restaurants. These were the most disgusting ones I’ve ever had. They’re not fresh (they taste heated up), there’s no salt on them, and they’re dry. DRY like I don’t know how it’s possible to have plantains with no moisture\n\n#3 the rotisserie chicken was dry, the only good part about it was the skin\n\n#4 the guacamole had absolutely no flavor\n\n#5 FISH- I got the breaded tilapia since everything else was being met with yells and flailing hands. This was so bad. So bad that there’s not much I can say. It tasted FREEZER BURNED. 😭 it was the worst fish I’ve ever had. It tasted distinctly like when you have fish sitting in the freezer for a long time and cook it, but that freezer burned taste can’t be removed. Completely not fresh, completely disgusting.\n\nPlease avoid this place, I wish we didn’t come here. I’ve never not taken food home from a restaurant but this food was so bad I couldn’t eat half my plate. And then the same manager didn’t hesitate to express his annoyance with me for not taking the rest of the food home."

Umm duh!\n\nThe food is well prepared and the price is right. The amount of avocado that they bring out with the salad is just amazing. Everything tasted especially good, no complaints on how anything here is prepared. Staff is very attentive and pleasant.\n\nI enjoyed the visit and can’t wait to come back"

I had their chicken burrito and it was fresh, not at all greasy ,  great portions and taste as good as it smells.  Worth the trip down to Ridgewood!"
