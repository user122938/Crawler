Over the last 4+ years, I consistently enjoy the classic and braised beef as well as a grilled pork sparingly. Their summer rolls are filling and the peanut sauce is close to perfect.\n\nI don’t often order pho from here, however I will pick up a side of broth almost every time I order.\n\nStaff is attentive, communicative, and sweet."

I do think that after that review things got much better. Sandwiches are way more moist. Mild is mild and spicy is definitely spicy. Substantial amount of meat and pickled veggies. I love it all!\nI’ll do say that if you get noodle salad, get double protein and double the fish sauce. You’ll most likely end up with left over iceberg salad otherwise. It’s so close and they’re always super fast. Just call for pick up. ⬆️\nI’m pretty sure the owners are the ones working there everyday. Who doesn’t love a gem like that?  :)"

Every time I ask, I expect it to be the 🌶️🌶️🌶️ level as indicated on the menu, and every single time it is milder than a cup of milk. Today I looked at the person taking my order in the eyes and asked “can I please ACTUALLY have it spicy?” to which they replied “yes,” and my sandwich came with half a sliver of jalapeño for the entire thing, and mayo milder than dew drops on a rose.\n\nIf the restaurant replies to this review and explains why they cannot make a spicy sandwich, and agrees to actually season my food as I ask, and to match the level advertised on the menu, I will update to five stars.\n\nUPDATED: thank you to Banh Mi Place for replying. Unfortunately, I went today and asked for a spicy sandwich, and it was still not spicy. See second photo with same half a jalapeño and mild sauce."

I also loved the creamy mayo and tangy pickled vegetables, which added a nice balance to the sandwich.\n\nUnfortunately, the pho was a major letdown. The broth tasted bland and watered down, more like the free soup you get with a lunch special than the rich, aromatic broth you’d expect from a good pho. It lacked the depth of flavor and the comforting warmth that make pho so special. The noodles and other ingredients couldn’t save it either."

Wish more bites I could have a whole taste.\nAs I thought about my experience returning home I remember the guy who took my order specifically said I would get “grilled”\nShrimp. I found that weird.
