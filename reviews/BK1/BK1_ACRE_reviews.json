I also ordered a tea but don’t remember what it was. It was a bit of wait but it was so worth it. The chicken was so juicy and crispy and the salad was refreshing. I walked out very satiated.

Came with salad, brussel sprouts, black (purple colored) rice, and pickled radishes. Portion size is good for breakfast. Not heavy.\n\nService was nice. It's not a fancy restaurant but a rustic Japanese coffee breakfast shop. Would come again."

Atmosphere and interior design of the restaurant is stylish. They use two elements for Interior design, it’s combining New York industrial style with natural wood. The wood material and color soften the style of steel. Outdoors dining is a fantastic choice, it’s very comfortable when the weather is good. I like the open kitchen and self-service. The pickled radish in the bento is delicious, and the Japanese fried chicken is tender and soft, which goes well with purple rice. However, the brussels sprouts are a bit too hard and too salty. As for salads, they have never been my favorite. You can also purchase high-quality made in Japan organic matcha powder for tea ceremonies use and other high quality items import from Japan. I will definitely come back."

I was surprised that this place is self-service and so follow the trend. For self-service price, the price should be cheaper. The ambiance is great, very Japanese garden style. I was glad I went early the day because when I passed by before, this place always packed and crowded but this time it wasn't busy at all. You order food and drink at the counter and pay then they give you an alarm to notify you when your food is ready then you go pick it up by yourself and bring it back to your seat. This place looks like a cafe style more that restaurant. You can bring your laptop or any work to work there as long as you want. By the way food taste good and the quality is amazing.\n\nreview on 1/4/23\nI just want to check out this restaurant, their menu is interesting, but I only have half hour left on my break, plus they close early so I don't have a chance to eat here. So I decided to just get a Cappuccino here.\n\nWhile I'm waiting, I walk around a small cafe area seeing nice stuff they sell. The coffee taste nice and I will find the time to come back to eat at this place."

They have spacious dining space and backyard where you can access after order your food in the front.\n\nWe had Chicken Nanban Bento Box, Pesto Avocado Sandwich, and Japanese Fried Chicken Karaage. Chicken Nanban is known as Miyazaki Style chicken dish. Fried chicken soaked in sweet vinegar and soy sauce based sauce. Then, they put creamy tartar sauce on the top. Chicken Nanban tastes fresh and crispy. The bento was served with purple rice, salad, Brussels sprouts, and pickled daikon. Pesto avocado sandwich was little citrus and full of fresh greens. They put smashed avocado, dill, basil pesto, and mozzarella cheese. I like citrus and herbs so I loved it so much. Chicken Karaage was also amazing. All food is made to order which made those Karaage so crispy and juicy. On the menu description, they said they put shoyu koji mayonnaise on the top. To me, the sauce had strong mustard flavor.\n\nTheir food feels very healthy and thoughtful. Even the side dishes on the bento had all its role and balance. A lot of gluten free options and some vegetarian options available. My stomach felt really comfortable after consuming their food. I see that their main purpose is to serve fresh, healthy yet hearty food. It is trustworthy to see them pursuing their goal here.\n\nDefinitely going back to Acre with lots of love!"

Also their system is weird - you need to order then you can sit down. There also isn't an easy place to get utensils or napkins.\n\nKarage bento box (3/5)- they gave me 4 pieces of chicken. Half of them were moist and had a crispy coating. The other two (which I think were old) were dry, and the batter was tough and difficult to eat. The rice however (4/5) was yummy - fluffy, moist, and tender. The 4 tiny pieces of diakon they gave me (5/5) were super flavorful: floral, tangy, and sweet.\n\nFrench fries (3/5) - some of the fries were hard and while the seasoning was nice it was SUPER salty.

I got Karrage while she got Chicken Nanban. Both were very juicy and fresh. I am really not a sauce guy but the sauce was not overwhelming at all. The rice was a bit bland? For some reason I expected more flavor since it was a little colorful. The Brussel sprouts and vegetables/salad were decent, vibrant and refreshing.\n\nI was skeptical at the value but we honestly got pretty full. For reference ~23 dollars per bento set. I got exactly full and she couldn't even finish a little of her meal. I have to say though, this definitely would not do the job for someone who has an above average appetite so take that into consideration. (We eat less).\n\nMy only issues were that the price was a bit high for, like others said, self service. For reference, it's similar to the situation in the KTOWN food court with the beeping devices.  What I'm not understanding, on top of why the prices are high for self service, is why we can't sit in/dine in after ordering a online pickup order if there's no substantial indoor service for customers.\n\nThe outside area was pretty cool and the bathroom was also really aesthetic, clean and sanitary. The front area also has a lot of cool antiques/items that add a nice touch.\n\nI would like to give a solid 4.5 stars but that's not an option; Definitely not 5 stars unfortunately."

            "text": "The dining experience at ACRE Japanese restaurant presented a series of disappointments, particularly considering the pricing of the menu items in relation to their quality. Expectations set by enticing photos fell significantly short during the visit, leaving a distinct feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nCommencing with the Karage Bites, the ratio of breading to chicken was notably imbalanced, leaning towards an excess of breading that compromised the essence of the chicken itself. Priced at $14, the dish failed to justify its value, lacking the expected harmony of flavors.\n\nThe Chicken Karage Sandwich, devoid of any sauce and comprising solely chicken and coleslaw, contradicted the anticipated presentation from the visuals seen beforehand. At $15, the lack of accompanying sauce contributed to a drier experience, undermining the perceived value.\n\nThe Egg Salad Sandwich, accompanied by seemingly uncooked bacon pieces, amounted to a regrettable disappointment considering its $18 price tag. Failing to satisfy the palate, the sandwich lacked the expected richness and fell short of the basic standards for an egg salad sandwich.\n\nThe Pesto Avocado Sandwich, priced at $14, represented a culmination of bitter and somewhat sour flavors, lacking in true essence and not justifying its cost.\n\nMoving to the Garden Salad, advertised to include quinoa, but disappointingly only offering a minuscule amount that didn't align with the expectations set by its $16 price point, left a dissatisfying impression.\n\nThe Salmon Bento Box, priced at $25, presented a meager portion of just two small pieces of salmon alongside rice and salad, failing to meet the standards of value and leaving a sense of disrespect towards patrons.\n\nWhile the Chicken Curry showcased flavorful chicken and sauce, the $21 price tag (excluding the unprovided extra rice) did not fully align with the overall value of the dish.\n\nThe Scallion Parmesan Scone, although an interesting pairing concept, failed to deliver a delightful taste experience. Similarly, the Ham and Cheese Croissant, though improved after being air fried, did not justify its $7 cost.\n\nAmong the desserts, the Matcha Cake offered subtle yet enjoyable flavors, potentially warranting a repeat order, while the Vanilla Cake, regrettably dry and exhibiting an unappealing oiliness, failed to meet expectations.\n\nOverall, the visit to ACRE Japanese restaurant was characterized by a pervasive sense of disappointment stemming from the underwhelming taste profiles and mismatched value propositions of most menu items. Given the high pricing coupled with the lackluster culinary offerings, this venture did not merit the investment in either time or money. Given the choice, it would not be a preferred dining destination in the future."

We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and while there was a bit of a line, it moved relatively quickly.\n\nWe got the Fried Chicken and Vegetable Bento Boxes. Both were great. The fried chicken and potato bites both had a crispy exterior and the chicken was still juicy on the inside. The Brussel Sprouts in particular were well-seasoned and scrumptious. I wish they served more of them with the boxes."

Happened to be just around the corner from me but I would have journeyed even a bit further to come here again for the food, relaxed atmosphere and maybe to buy some of the beautiful Japanese ceramics next time. Highly recommend the matcha latte, salmon bento and the chocolate chip cookie was a delicious close. Will be back!"

I was recommended this place because they offer \"authentic bento box, not just salmon teriyaki stuff\".\n\nI had the fried chicken bento box and it was delicious. Delicious and tasty, two pieces were dark meat, two were white meat, and all of it was delicious. The rest of the menu looked very tasty too.\n\nThe space itself is huge! Plus there's garden seating in back, the front is a cafe and store. A true gem in Greenpoint"

Can get pretty busy on weekends.\nI like their bento boxes - tasty and pretty healthy. Not anything super special or intricate but straight forward. Would recommend the salmon bento box and the chicken nanban bento box.\nIf you're planning on dining in, keep in mind the dining area is more of a self-serve food court experience."
