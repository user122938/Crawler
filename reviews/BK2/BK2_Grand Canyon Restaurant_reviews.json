Some of our food was really hot, others not so much but you get a TON of food and all was very good. No complaints basically and we’d def will go again."

So we sent it back. Instead of bringing a better sandwich or apologizing in any way. They simply brought the check with the sandwich still on it. Not even an attempt to satisfy the customer. I asked the waiter, who then got nasty with me, and said, “go talk to the owner!”\n\nSo I went up to him. He was rude, unreasonable, disrespectful. “No one has ever had a complaint.” So? The meat was dry and the taste was not good. He didn’t care. I then said, “ I’m not paying for it.” This is how you handle customer service?\n\nI paid the bill. Less the amount of the bad sandwich. And simply handed it to the waiter.  Who really did not deserve my very good tip.\n\nThe prices are insanely expensive. To give you an idea. Just a side salad is $10.00.\n\nI will not go there again."
