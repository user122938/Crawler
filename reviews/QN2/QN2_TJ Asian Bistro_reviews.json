It was very fresh.   Miso soup came with my salmon platter, even on a hot summer day I still enjoed… I LOVE Agedashi dōfu, it was perfectly made and paired with a not to salty sauce. Dessert was also delicious, I had the fried banana with red bean ice cream.. THE POUR - PLUM WINE\n\nThe only issue I had was my waitress for got me . I had to ask other wait staff for water, dessert and my bill and never asked if I wanted anything else."

We decided to dine in since the weather was cold and no other person was inside either. I have to say the host was very warm and welcoming to us. He made us feel very comfortable and took every possible measure to maintain 6ft distance from us when taking our order and serving our meals. We ordered a soft crab shell which was a great starter because we were hungry. We shared this hot appetizer  amongst us two. Then came our 2 special rolls, which were the “Amazing Roll” and the second one was “Special Kaye Roll”! Both were freshly made and the taste was to its perfection. We enjoyed these rolls with eel sauce! My husband enjoyed sparkling water and I enjoyed their Japanese  home made tea. The tea was nicely hot and went perfect with our sushi rolls. I am a tea lover and rarely enjoy outside home teas but their tea was really great in taste.no desserts for us. We were full with all this food.  A must go SUSHI SPOT FOR ANY ONE LOOKING TO enjoy A QUIET PLACE WITH GREAT TASTE AND FRESHLY MADE 🍣 sushi!"

The staff were amazing, very attentive, and welcoming. I was shocked at how busy it was around 1:30pm, which was a good sign that the food was good.\n\nThey have an extensive Asian/sushi menu, including a separate lunch special menu. We both ordered the lunch special that included a soup, small salad and option of meat, rice, and a sushi/California roll. I don't eat seafood, so I ordered the cucumber roll, and my friend had the avocado roll. This was my first time eating three cucumber rolls, and surprisingly, it was tasty. I enjoyed my entire meal, and it was fulfilling. I was able to take a small to go bag of my rice and teriyaki chicken. My friend ate all of hers and we were both satisfied with our meal and the service. We both enjoyed our refills of the hot tea throughout our meal, and you had the option of water as well.\n\nThis is definitely a cool spot to check out, and I would definitely return to check out some other menu items."
