One can make a dish off of the snack foods and smaller dishes by themselves; the standard rice platter that came with the aforementioned chicken lasted me for a few days, there was so much.  They also have a wide variety of breakfast dishes and don't mind customizing them as needed."

I call the store and ask just for a refund for my fish stew that is missing and they give me the run around about how one of the food on my order is actually higher than what it says on their menu AND that I never ordered the fish stew!
