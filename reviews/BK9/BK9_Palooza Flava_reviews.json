We ended up getting three of the seafood specials: chili mango shrimp, curry lobster, and curry crab.  All three were very delicious, as well as all the sides (rice, chow mien, plantains).  Ginger strawberry lemonade is also great.  Only downside is that there isn't a large seating area to eat it, but that's pretty common for most places around here."

Yesss, Ima try the fried chicken and hot wings next but I just had to share because this place is good!\n\nTheir drinks are great too! The sorrel has ginger! (I mention bc too many places don’t add it 🥺)\n\nAlso just a tip, get the fried rice and not the rice and peas (it tastes better). Your welcome!"
