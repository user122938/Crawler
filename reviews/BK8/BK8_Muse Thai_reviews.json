From the moment you walk in, the aroma, presentation, and balance of flavors transport you straight to Bangkok. Every dish feels elevated yet comforting modern Thai cuisine done right.\n\nWe tried the Spicy Wagyu Beef, perfectly tender with just the right heat, and the Branzino, which was fresh, flaky, and full of vibrant Thai spices. The Muse Bay Noodles were a highlight bold, saucy, and packed with flavor. For appetizers, the VS Wings (with both BKK Wings and Thom Wings flavors) were crispy, juicy, and addictive, while the Pork Bao was soft and savory perfection.\n\nTo drink, the Mojito Fizzy and Non-Alcoholic Negroni were refreshing and beautifully crafted the kind of mocktails that prove you don’t need alcohol to have a great time.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy yet sophisticated, with excellent service and presentation that matches the quality of the food. Whether you’re planning a date night, dinner with friends, or just exploring Thai cuisine, Muse Thai stands out as one of the top Thai restaurants in NYC."

We walked in still wearing our medals, tired but excited, and were greeted with warm smiles and the amazing aroma of Thai spices.\n\nEvery dish hit the spot. Pure comfort food after 26.2 miles.\n\nService was kind and quick, even though we were a big, hungry group. The staff congratulated us on finishing the marathon, which made the experience even more special.\nIf you're looking for a place to refuel with amazing flavors, generous portions, and genuine hospitality, Muse Thai is the place. After running across all five boroughs, this meal tasted like victory."

The cocktails were tasty!\nService was impatient and felt rather annoyed with us the whole time. Frequently they tried to clear dishes far before they were done (a couple ribs still on the plate, 1/3 cocktail left, we had to ask them to drop//bring back the plate multiple times). We were not moving slow and there were open tables but our waitress was pushy.\nMaybe worth a try but not convinced about all the 5-star reviews."

The food is out of this world – the grilled meats are as good as any top Texas BBQ joint. The crispy pork skin and coconut ice cream are a must. If you're touring apartments in Brooklyn, you have to see this building and then eat here. It's the perfect combo! A 5-star experience all around."

It was our first visit, but Alex was very extremely friendly and he introduced us to their specialties. I especially liked the BBQ pork appetizer. The meat was very tender and the sauce hit my Cantonese taste buds perfectly. The beef rib massaman curry was also excellent too. We requested it not too spicy and it turned out extremely flavorful. I also really appreciated the little details, like the decor and presentation of the dishes. The overall vibe was great, and I'd love to come back again on a Tuesday night to enjoy the live Jazz!"

The waitresses were rude trying to take away our food and plates while me and my friend were still eating. They kept asking whether we are \"doing good\" to sound like they care about us but their actions prove that they don't care about what customer truly needs: a leeway for us to enjoy food leisurely. The group next to our table seated after we came was talking really loud and constantly moving in and out, making the couch shake every time they get up.

This place is such a hidden gem in Brooklyn — the food, the ambiance, and the service were all spot-on.\n\nWe ordered quite a few dishes and every single one impressed us. The crispy pork belly basil fried rice was my personal favorite — super flavorful, with perfectly crisp pork and aromatic basil. The boneless duck drunken noodles were also outstanding: rich, slightly spicy, and loaded with tender duck.\n\nWe also had the chicken wings, rock shrimp, and shrimp & calamari in Thai curry — all well-executed and seasoned beautifully. For dessert, the banana coconut sticky rice was a comforting, sweet finish. Highly recommend it if you’re a fan of traditional Thai sweets.\n\nOn top of the great food, the atmosphere was lovely. The restaurant has a charming semi-outdoor garden space surrounded by flowers — it honestly felt like dining in a little tropical escape. Even the tableware was elegant and thoughtful.\n\nDon’t miss their cocktails! We tried Passion in You and Purple Love — both delicious and visually stunning.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and attentive, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. I’ll definitely be coming back, and bringing friends next time!"

            "text": "Easily became my favorite Thai spot in Brooklyn. I ordered: (1) mango salad, (2) curry puffs, (3) crispy pork over thai basil fried rice, (4) lava shrimp, and (5) mango sticky rice. My absolute favorite was the crispy pork--crunchy on the outside but tender and fatty on the inside. It paired perfectly with the thai basil fried rice, which cut through the fat of the pork. I was overall impressed with the quality of the mango in the salad and sticky rice, which other thai restaurants often miss. The mangos were perfectly ripe. Service was also great; tentative but not pushy. This would be a great date spot.\n\nFor more food reviews, check out chloenicholle on IG!"

            "text": "A Thai restaurant with great style. Their Drunken Noodles are the most highly recommended! I've been dreaming about them ever since trying them at a night market in Thailand, and I haven't seen this dish at any other Thai restaurants in New York. When the Drunken Noodles arrived, the first thing I noticed was that irresistible wok hei aroma. The noodles and squid rings were slightly charred and coated in a savory, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce—it tasted just like the night market in Thailand!\n\nThe other dishes were also excellent:\n**BKK Wings** – Crispy on the outside and tossed in a sweet, sour, and spicy sauce that really whets the appetite.\n**Beef Rib Massaman Curry** – The beef ribs were braised until tender, and the curry was rich with a blend of spices. It was delicious paired with roti or rice, especially when mixed with the flavorful sauce.\n**Whole Crispy Branzino with Mango Salad** A huge fried fish, perfectly crispy, drizzled with a tangy mango salad dressing. Refreshing and satisfying.\n\nThe restaurant also offers many creative cocktails 🍹. On Tuesday nights, starting at 7 PM, there’s free live jazz music. The vibe is super chill, making it perfect for catching up with friends or a date."

The service is extremely quick and friendly, even with it being very busy. I absolutely loved it and can’t wait to go back."

            "text": "Absolutely loved this place! Here are my top picks:\n•\tPanang Curry (Boneless Duck) – MUST TRY! The duck is crispy outside, tender inside, and the coconut curry is perfectly balanced (a little spicy, not too sweet). The sauce alone is worth two bowls of rice. Loved the chestnut-like baby pumpkin too—rare to find it this good in restaurants.\n•\tSmall Island “Khao Soy” (Chicken Wings) – Rich Tom Yum–inspired broth with crispy fried noodles on top and instant noodles underneath that soak up all the flavor. Comforting and addictive!\n•\tPad Thai (Shrimp) – Sweet and classic, with peanuts, lime, and scallions to balance it out. Don’t miss their house-made chili sauce—it’s super fragrant and packs a punch.\n•\tVS. Wings (BKK & Thom) – Thai-style fried chicken wings. The BKK (sweet & sour with a little spice) was my favorite. Thom is more like honey wings, also tasty but less complex.\n•\tPeanut Dumplings – Unique surprise! More like rice rolls stuffed with sweet peanut filling. Chewy, nutty, and fun to try.\n•\tMango Sticky Rice – Could use a bit more coconut cream, but still satisfying.\n•\tCocktails (Just A Minute & Purple Love) – Purple Love is fruity and easy to drink, while Just A Minute is stronger with a long finish.\n\nOverall, the flavors were amazing and nothing felt greasy. I’d definitely come back and highly recommend the duck Panang Curry and the VS. Wings."

Muse thank you for creating recipes with these flavors, it was a beautiful experience and can't wait to try the rest of the menu.\n\nLemonade was a hit!\nAppetizers:\nbbq ribs outrageously tender, fall off the bone, better than some bbq restaurants.\nPork buns were sweet, sticky, crispy and flavor from the Thai gods.\nWow the Chicken massaman curry was life changing, think last meal of your life scale... like every bite better than the last life changing...like arriving home on a full stomach, dreaming about eating more life changing.\nDesert coconut pudding was just WOW\n\nUpdated 1 day after: Pondering all night, i wanted to try Muse again, food couldn't be that good, maybe I was starving when I wrote the first review yesterday. Well long story short, it was not a fluke, Muse is a bonafide must try restaurant. No question, no need to think about it, just get up, walk out the door and head straight there.\n\nChicken wings were crispy, sticky, just finger licking delicious. They should sell that sauce at the supermarket.\n\nChicken dumplings were also great."
