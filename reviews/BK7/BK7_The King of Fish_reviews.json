            "text": "King of Fish is probably fun as a bar but as a restaurant it’s pretty mid. It clearly has had a lot of money put into the interior design and merchandising and it has an interesting menu, so I was expecting more, as I had a decent time here a few years ago.\n\nThe bar area looks really nice but then there’s all this random AirBnb “live laugh love” style art just randomly applied all over the walls of the place. The audio was a YouTube music video playlist blasting on the TV and speakers at an obnoxious volume too loud to hear anyone speaking. There was no air conditioning on a hot day, just fans pointing at the ceiling; we had to go outside because it was unbearable.\n\nThe food was average and the service bad. A big sign out front advertised oysters and was why I stopped in, but nope no Oysters today. Our drinks sat on the bar for ten minutes before we asked about them and then they were brought over. When they finally made it over, they tasted fine, though they weren’t anything to write home about. The lobster roll, shrimp, and seafood empanadas we ordered were fine, we enjoyed them, and the presentation was good, but it wasn’t anything special. The seafood in them didn’t feel fresh and seemed likely frozen, Costco level. The premium pricing for the average food was pretty frustrating. Service was disjointed: drinks took forever and it took multiple requests to get napkins and forks.\n\nThe payment experience was terrible: when you get the bill, they give you a big laminated card that says they don’t take cards, just Zelle and cash. The Zelle goes to the owners personal account, possibly to avoid paying taxes on revenue, the ATM charges a $3 fee like it’s a bank, and regardless of how you pay, they add a 2.59% “service fee” like they’re UberEats or something. If you have a restaurant built out like this and charging this much money for average food, you need to take card and not do this penny-pinching small business owner stuff. This place is a great example that not every small business is worth supporting."

While also having a great menu should you want a full meal, grab some calamari to start and a wide variety of seafood tacos to order from, all at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is very lively with either afrobeats or mexican regional music playing  consistently as well as some pop hits in between.\n\nCaution: Beware as they only take cash and can’t process credit or debit card payments at the time of review! This isn’t apparent and may catch you off guard, very unfortunate as credit and debit card POS are a standard for all other restaurants in the area."

All fresh house made ingredients.\n\nThe food was also just as amazing. We tried the garlic butter shrimp, guacamole and agua chile shrimp. All were yummy and fresh with the right amount of spice.\n\nI tried the fish and lobster tacos. Both were food dance inducing! The homemade corn tortillas were hearty and held up to the generous fillings.\n\nI also tried the crab pilon which was a taco served on a fried plantain.

These were supposed to be Lobster tacos. Do you see any Lobster in those tacos?? Perhaps a microscopic piece that you have to really look for. Very disappointing. I even asked the employee if the Lobster tacos had sufficient Lobster meat in them and he said \"absolutely, they are big\". Seriously? This is what you call sufficient Lobster meat? I think nonexistent would be a better description. Besides this huge disappointment that left me hungry and feeling ripped off....I was also told that I cannot pay with a credit card, which is very odd for a restaurant, and even more odd because I ordered from this restaurant the day before and paid with a card without any issue. And i expressed that to the employee and he looked at me with confusion and said he has no idea how i paid with a card since they only take cash. Meanwhile they are using a POS system that clearly takes all payment types. Seems like they make up rules as they go. When i clearly expressed frustration amd confusion with these made up rules...he suddendly changed the tune and suddendly said they do accept cards. This was ridiculous and clearly selective service based on customer, as they feel like it. And if all that wasnt horrible enough, I look at the check and realize they charged more than 4% surcharge for using my card. I have been in the payments industry for 20 years and know  very well that it is ILLEGAL to surcharge customers more than 4% for card payments. The law clearly caps the maximum charge to 4%. I expressed that to the employee and the manager (who claimed not to speak English)....and they got very annoyed and instead of apologizing and acknowledging they are conducting business in an ILLEGAL way, they charged me the higher rate regardless. This business is clearly running in a very shady and unethical manner. Not only did they deceive me and not provide adequate food but they are selective in who they allow to pay with cards, and when they do take cards they ILLEGALLY charge a surcharge higher than the law allows. Very frustrating and unpleasant experience."

I do want to add that it was drizzling, so that could be why the restaurant was not super busy. The ambiance has a nice, cozy feel and they commit to the nautical theme with their outfits! There was a prettier seating area in the back, but it looked like it was under renovation.\n\nI had three tacos: shrimp ($6), fish ($6), and octopus ($7). My friend got the platter sampler ($20). The highlight was the freshness of the seafood. That being said, I do like the taste of fresh shrimp, light fish, and octopus, but find the profiles to be on the mild side. I can appreciate the lightness but prefer a more robust flavor profile playing with sauces, spices, and vegetables in the taco. I also liked that their taco shell was robust enough to not fall apart but maintained the soft-taco vibes. My favorite was the fish because the batter provided more flavor.\n\nService here was warm and welcoming! Our original server just spoke Spanish, so the bartender stepped in to help us translate. They did multiple check backs to make sure we were okay and did not pressure us with the check. If you're looking for cozy vibes and fresh seafood small bites, then check out The King of Fish!"

            "text": "I get around New York.  I eat at several restaurants and visit many cocktail bars each month.  Recently I’ve been on a taco tour.\n\nIf you read my reviews, you’ll notice I try to rate fairly and as highly as possible as long as it’s honest.\n\nI want everyone to know that this experience is DIFFERENT.  If I could rate The King of Fish 10 stars, I would.  I texted someone as I sipped my final cocktail of the evening and said, “I’m sipping this last cocktail as slowly as possible because it’s just me, the Venezuelan owner, and another patron originally from Chile.  It’s somehow magical.”\n\nThis really was a magical night.  These are the kind of nights that made me fall in love with New York and has kept me here for the last three years.  This seafood place and bar is so laid back and fun.  They have live entertainment.  Tonight was jazz.\n\nIt feels like a community.  The owner made all of my drinks personally, and he’s one of the nicest and most personable people I’ve ever met.  He made me feel like we had known each other for years.  The servers were attentive and were people so cool I would want them to be my friends.\n\nI came here because another local business owner said he had the best fish tacos of his life here.  And he was right.  The fish is fresh, tender and flaky, and well seasoned.  They were different than any fish taco I’ve ever had.  They were served with three different sauces—hot, medium, and mild.  I love spice, but I enjoyed all three flavors.  They are big, meaty tacos.  Not tiny.  Three was the perfect number, though the fish was so light and tasty, I could have had more.\n\nThe cocktail program here is INSANE.  I spend a lot of time in Manhattan, particularly the lower east side.  And I’ve had some good drinks.  But the drinks in Manhattan are 18 dollars at the very best.  22-23 dollars on average.  And some places charge 30, 40, 50 or more for specialty cocktails.\n\nThese cocktails are some of the best, if not THE best, I’ve had in a long time.  I’m tempted to say they are some of the best I’ve ever had in my life, but I’m riding so high on the ambiance and feelings of happiness, I may be a little biased.\n\nFirst, please know they make all of their fruit ingredients fresh.  No cheap substitutes.  Second, their mezcal menu is out of this world.  Third, these cocktails are super duper reasonably priced, most 13-16 dollars.  And for what you’re getting—an absolute steal.\n\nI had the chilo (mezcal, pineapple, lemon, tamarindo).  I adored the naguara (mezcal, pisco, smoked pineapple—literally—and aguave).  The naguara was like a magic show, as I watched it be smoked under a bell-housing.\n\nI also had the zicatela (mezcal, grand marnier, pineapple, agave, worm salt).  And finished with the El Uyuyuy (mezcal, guava fruit, hibiscus, st. Germain, lime).\n\nSomehow even the tequila shot and lime wedge at the end was the best I’ve ever had.\n\nPrices are great.  People are amazing.  Fish tacos spectacular.  They have a menu teeming with fantastic fish dishes.  Drinks so good I might go back tomorrow.  If not tomorrow, definitely soon.\n\nThe owner told me he’d spent years crafting this menu, and I believe him.\n\nThe owner has also opened another restaurant nearby that I can’t wait to try.\n\nThis is my New York."

The waiter seemed busy but were very attentive and helpful to us.\nI believe they are related to The King of Meat on the same street."

            "text": "Popped into [Bar Restaurant Name] for a midweek bite and a couple of drinks. The vibe was solid – dim lighting, decent music in the background (thankfully not too loud), and a good mix of people. It felt relaxed without being dead.\n\nThe drinks menu was impressive – loads of choice, from local craft beers to decent cocktails. I went for a classic G&T which was well-made, though a bit on the pricey side. Food-wise, it was a bit of a mixed bag. The starters came out quickly and were tasty – especially the calamari, which was crisp and not greasy. Mains took a bit longer, and while my burger was juicy and packed with flavour, the chips were underwhelming – could’ve been hotter and crispier."
