            "text": "I came here with my fiancée for our anniversary while visiting from London. The setting and view are stunning, and the food was excellent, though we were surprised to find it was a set menu at $195 per person. The hostesses were very welcoming and accommodating, which we appreciated.\n\nHowever, our experience was let down by the behaviour of some of the waiters. I noticed a few of them laughing when I was taking photos of the view, something plenty of other guests were doing. In particular, the tall middle-aged waiter with glasses (mentioned in other reviews as well) seemed to mock us as he passed our table, which was uncomfortable and unprofessional.\n\nIt left us wondering whether this was just poor service or something more concerning. I think the restaurant could benefit from some staff training around professionalism and respect, especially given the fine-dining prices and reputation."

The food on the menu is Michelin-star quality dishes. The River Café offers a dine-in experience or a dine-in experience for extravagant weddings. I recently had my sister’s wedding reception here and everything from the ceremony to the cake cutting was handled with care. It was a top-notch experience. The staff were very polite. The prices were high, and the high costs will bring you top-quality service and Michelin-starred dishes. I highly recommend you try this restaurant out."

Hard being a vegetarian with allergies (although, gave heaps of notice).\nThe staff needed to smile (only one managed this).  Especially the host that greeted us, he came across as rude and cold.\nThe cafe style cane chairs weren't comfortable and a little out of place to rest of the restaurant atmosphere.\nIt was summer when we went and the air con was extremely cold but I guess this was to cater for the males having to wear a jacket (at all times).\nIf you are staying in NYC you will have to organise transport (we allowed 45mins).\nThis is a very expensive restaurant that left no memorable impression.  Definitely not worth the money.\nAnd ladies if you are going here, even in summer - bring your jacket just in case.\nWe had also requested a window table since we were coming from Australia for a special birthday - we did not get that."

            "text": "Definitely not worth it. I was very disappointed in this experience especially considering the steep price tag. The best part of going here was the entrance autumn decor and the sunset drive over Brooklyn bridge. We were seated at a rubbish table even though I had booked back in February and the restaurant wasn't fill at the time of reservation. So we had a horrible view of the back wall and the service station (I saw they did this to numerous young couples). If you have a yearning for the \"experience\" I would recommend you stop by the outside to take in the views of the exterior decorations and maybe pop in for a glass of wine at the bar, and then take yourself elsewhere for a decent meal and good service. Service is just meh, the food is not memorable or particularly well executed. The duck was very tender and so was the octopus. But the dishes as a whole were not tasty or good quality. The souffle was curdled and had scrambled eggs vibes and the cheap chocolate used on the bridge dessert made it pretty awful."

When we asked to be seated there, we were told, “Sorry, but those tables are reserved.”\n\nThe food, in all honesty, did not live up to the price. We understand that part of the cost reflects the beautiful view, but even taking that into account, the quality was not satisfactory. Moreover, my wife felt unwell after the meal.\n\nThe overall atmosphere did not reflect the standards of a fine restaurant: the environment was noisy, with many shouting customers, and the venue itself appeared somewhat outdated and in need of renovation.\n\nOn a positive note, the view was truly stunning, and the staff’s kindness was greatly appreciated. However, the inconsistency regarding table reservations—being told it was impossible for us, yet seemingly available to others—was disappointing and frankly unacceptable."

The view is amazing and foods are really delicious especially try the duck’s liver and chocolate Brooklyn bridge dessert. I have one problem with the seating, please take a look at my first photo. Do I even look like I am dining in michellin stars fine dining restaurant? Service is great except the guy who took responsible for seats. He has a bit of attitude on his face since we are asians and I felt discrimination for first time in fine dining restaurant. He is old, tall, wore glasses and wearing long black coat. There are plenty of seats available(nobody come to sit at there until we are done with our dinner) and he is not willing to change the seats for us(especially he doesn’t even say sorry, he shrinks his face like he felt bothered by us and use high tone of voice). I mean what a great customer service for almost $500 dinner. Other servers and waiters were very helpful and friendly. Only that guys has a problem and he deserves to get fired 🙂‍↕️ He literally destroyed my photography girly dream!!!!"

Unfortunately, the experience fell far short of what one would expect from such a prestigious establishment.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the service felt cold and uninviting. There was a noticeable lack of warmth and attentiveness—it genuinely felt as though we weren’t treated like guests. The level of hospitality simply didn’t match the reputation the restaurant carries.\n\nThe food was also underwhelming. For a place with such a longstanding legacy, I expected a memorable and refined culinary experience. Instead, the dishes lacked flavor, creativity, and finesse. For the price, it’s simply not the most worthwhile food in New York there are plenty of other restaurants in the city offering far better meals at a similar or even lower cost.\n\nThe only highlight of the evening was the ambiance the view of the Brooklyn Bridge is undeniably beautiful and adds charm to the setting. Sadly, that was the only part of the evening that lived up to the restaurant’s reputation.\n\nOverall, what should have been a festive and elevated dining experience turned out to be a major letdown. For a restaurant that claims such exclusivity and history, it simply didn’t deliver on food, service, or value"

After we finished dinner, it took over 20 minutes for our dessert to arrive—meanwhile, guests who were seated after us were served and had even left before we were done, which was pretty disappointing. I’d also heard there was an à la carte menu available, but we were only offered the prix fixe—decent, but it would’ve been nice to have more options.

Servers need to NOT walk across the dance floor in the middle of first bride and groom dance, father daughter dance and mother son dance!!!! Why would they do that??! Venue is hard to deal with. Multiple surprises in the week before the wedding. Was told if there is a tent stood up by another event early afternoon prior to the wedding, they don't have time to take it down so the wedding will have to sucks the sucks to keep the tent, rain or shine!! This venue restricts to a short list of DJs and florists whether you like them or not!! The DJ backed out because he claims his flight has to be delayed and can't come back in time. Well, it sounded like we have never traveled internationally to have to believe that! No bride and groom should have to be strssed with their last minute surprises, attitude and insensitivity! They really shouldn't think they are sitting in a pot of gold. This is a nice place for occasions but for weddings, you really need to understand what you are getting into because they require 50% down when you book which can be 1.5 years in advance."

Cuando llamo al restaurante me dice que no he respondido al teléfono el día anterior y que por eso se me ha cancelado, les digo que soy de España y que mi número no está operativo ahí que solo dispongo de WhatsApp a lo que me dicen que es su protocolo pero que van a ver si me pueden hacer un hueco …. Finalmente me dicen que si …. Cuando llegamos la mesa ya no era la que yo había pedido al lado de la ventana sino al fondo …. Aún sabiendo que era una ocasión especial les dio igual ….\nÍbamos vestidos super elegantes yo con un vestido corto negro y tacones y mi marido con un traje completo negro .. ese día hizo bastante calor 28 grados y la noche era calurosa en el restaurante la verdad que hacía calor …. A mitad de la cena mi marido se quitó la chaqueta del traje quedándose con la camisa de manga larga negra y el pantalón de traje negro y al segundo apareció el camarero diciendo que se la tenía que poner , que ahí el protocolo era cenar con la chaqueta puesta, les dijimos que hacía calor pero les dio igual ….\nUn trato que deja mucho que desear por no decir que los camareros era todos unos bordes que he contestaban con monosílabos\n\nEn cuanto a la comida estaba bastante buena pero el precio fuera de lugar un menú bastante normal y fueron 250€ por persona y la bebida aparte por no hablar de los 100€ de propina que nos obligaron a dejar sin duda nada valía ese precio por muy bueno que estuviera ….\n\nEso si las vistas espectaculares !\n\nNo volvería ni lo recomiendo j"

The service is just as fantastic, the team is so attentive of each guests and the couple, and we’re very communicative with us as the documentation team. This space is absolutely stunning, our couple had their ceremony on the terrace and it was the most gorgeous, intimate scene for their “I Do’s”.\n\nDestiny & Alyson were our contacts for day of coordination with the venue and they were lovely to work with as well!"

            "text": "Me and my husband discovered this restaurant a few years ago, in winter, and promised ourselves to come back in the summer to enjoy a dinner on the terrace overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. For this reason, we made a reservation over a month in advance, clearly requesting a table with a view. We were surprised to learn that, despite the early booking, they couldn’t guarantee it—clearly poor organization.\nA few days before our visit, they contacted us to reconfirm the reservation. We reiterated that it was a special occasion and that the view was very important to us. They replied that they would do their best.\nUpon arrival, the manager informed us that no table with a view was available. We explained that we had come all the way from Italy specifically for this experience and were willing to wait, even for a long time. In a rather unwelcoming tone, he said the wait could be up to 50 minutes—clearly trying to discourage us. We decided to stay anyway, ordered a drink at the bar, and asked if we could take it out to the terrace to enjoy the sunset and take a few photos. The bartender was very kind and said it was fine. But as we approached the terrace, the manager abruptly stopped us, saying there was a private event.\nWe explained we just wanted a couple of minutes for photos and would finish the drink elsewhere if needed, but he remained firm. We pointed out that, had we known certain areas were unavailable, we would have chosen a different night. After all, we were paying for the full experience, not just a limited part of the venue.\nAt that point—almost as if to appease our disappointment—a dinner table suddenly became available. But the atmosphere had already been ruined.\nDespite the beauty of the place, we do not recommend this restaurant, especially due to the way we were treated. The service does not live up to the high prices."

The service, from the entrance by the valet parking staff, the reception, the sommelier, Steve, the waiters and the rest of the restaurant staff who served us was exceptional.\n\nMy wife and I went to celebrate our anniversary, like other couples, and they seated us at the window to contemplate the spectacular view of the East River.\nI highly recommend the cocktail 77. The rabbit and the duck were delicious, not to mention the chocolate Brooklyn dessert, accompanied by a good coffee to finish.\n\nAn experience with an unconventional view and an excellent place for a special occasion, especially if it is with the person you love.\n\nThanks again to The River Café for making our anniversary feel more pleasant."

            "text": "Found a last minute reservation for a table of four to celebrate a birthday and it did not disappoint. Everything was spectacular from the service to the food to the music. The history and charm of the establishment is delicately spoken throughout the interior and the staff are very professional. The menu is prefixed at $195 per person before taxes and tips. With drinks, it is about $250 per person. The food was meticulously well presented and tasted wonderful. The atmosphere is elegant and it is not loud at all to have a conversation. The dress code is consistently enforced, so be prepared.\n\nAdvice: the waitstaff responsible for clearing the plates and the table can use help for larger tables of four. When there was only one waitstaff available to clear the table, he resorted to clearing the table in between two guests, on the right side and the left side of one and the other guest, instead of taking the time to clear away from the guest rather in front of the guest. This caused a steak knife to come centimeters away from grazing one of the guest’s eyes as he was clearing the plates."

While they do have a dress code, it added to the upscale feel of the evening and wasn’t an issue for us. The food was exceptional—every dish was flavorful, and the meat was cooked to perfection. To top it off, the breathtaking view made the evening even more memorable. It was the perfect choice for celebrating our anniversary."

From the moment we arrived at The River Café, we were treated with the utmost care and attention. The entire experience felt elevated and elegant, from the exquisite menus to the beautifully curated bar area.The food was executed to perfection, every plate was a surprise, dining here is an experience for sure, but it was the impeccable, white-glove service that truly set the evening apart. My husband called it the best birthday he’s ever had—and I took him to Puerto Rico last year! A truly stunning experience we’ll cherish forever."
