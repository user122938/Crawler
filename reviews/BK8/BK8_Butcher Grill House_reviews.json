From the moment we arrived, everything was handled with such professionalism, care, and attention to detail.\n\nThe food was absolutely incredible — every single dish was bursting with flavor, beautifully prepared, and served fresh. There was a huge variety, and plenty of food for everyone. Our guests kept commenting on how delicious everything was, whether it was appetizers , main courses, or desserts, every bite was perfection.\n\nWhat really took the experience to the next level was the staff. They were attentive, kind, and extremely responsive throughout the entire evening. Anything we needed was taken care of almost immediately, and they consistently went above and beyond to make sure we and our guests were comfortable and happy. It’s rare to find service that’s both so efficient and so genuinely warm.\n\nThe ambiance was also lovely — the space was clean, welcoming, and set up perfectly for our group. Everything ran so smoothly, and we were able to truly enjoy ourselves without having to worry about a thing.\n\nAll in all, it was more than just a meal — it was an experience. Avi and the entire staff made my mother’s 75th birthday party an absolute success!! I would highly, highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to host a party or simply enjoy a fantastic meal. We will definitely be back!"

Butcher grill house was an unexpected visit for me it was a restaurant I had never heard of it before but decided to take a risk and it was worth it because Butcher grill house in Crown Heights is a gem of a restaurant. I ordered the 30 ounce cowboy steak and it was everything you could ask for tender juicy flavorful cooked to a tea and that wasn’t even the best stake of the night the Delmonico oh the Delmonico it’s flavor surpassed any steak I’ve ever had in Brooklyn and was the best steak of the night. I think these steaks had to be up there with greats like reserve cut, and Tabernacle but the steaks weren’t all they had. The steaks didn’t even begin to scratch the service. They had these amazing tender Shawarma tacos, these delicious beef, guacamole bombs, and the best appetizer I think I had all night were the chicken wings another thing that when perfected can be so good Parking Wasn’t  amazing, but it was certainly worth it. My one critique on this restaurant is that the napkins are low quality and hard to use beside from this. It gets my five stars."

            "text": "While visiting Brooklyn, we tried a new restaurant that we haven’t been to yet. The name: Butcher Grill House in Crown Heights. Upon walking in, I was surprised at how modern and sleek the place looked. It was very open with plenty of seating and get this… Jewish music. We were introduced to the owner and his partner chef Ben Davidov, who is a master of flavor. We started with the Beef Carpaccio with balsamic drizzle, and garlic mayo on top of the bruschetta. We also had the Sweet and Sour Chicken Bites topped with sesame seed and scallions and a side of truffle mayo. The Beef Carpaccio was off the hook, you have to layer everything on a piece of bruschetta: the radish, roasted garlic, beef and arugula and just close your eyes and let the flavors fill up your mouth. It was the perfect bite. We finished the whole thing in minutes. Eric, our waiter, kept on bringing out dish after dish. Next was the Ben’s cauliflower with green tahini cream, crushed tomatoes, crispy puff bulgur, honey dates and ufra pepper glaze, it definitely lived up to the hype. We were still deep into our first two appetizers when Eric came back with more plates. It was Chef Cigar Rolls with pulled brisket and get this… cranberries. I know, sweet and tangy but savory and crunchy on the outside. He also brought the Butchers pulled beef flatbread with honey mustard truffle oil pulled brisket, pickled red onions, garlic confit and pesto aioli. That alone was enough to fill us up. It was soft, yet crunchy and not soggy. Then came along the Mexican Corn Ribs, fried and seasoned with a mixture of aromatic spices and topped with a garlic aioli. I love corn and unlike most corn ribs, the flavor was subtle and not hit you in the face, which we appreciated. As we were trying to make just a little dent into all that, Eric was back with something that I have been craving. You see following their Instagram I have seen this item and it peaked my interest and I was dying to try it. It’s called the Garlic Guac Beef Bombs. What it is, is a flaky and delicious croissant filled with slow-cooked bulled beef, zesty chimichurri, fresh arugula, roasted garlic, guacamole and a touch of sweet honey. If that sounds like a lot for a bite, it is! But it works oh so well. My wife and I each took one and split the third. It was sticky, sweet, and savory and one of the best things I ate that night. Our next dish was a new one not even on the menu, Shawarma Tacos, It has green tahini with crushed tomatoes, purple cabbage and chicken shawarma. I folded mine over and bit into all that goodness and was happy that we took a break before we resumed eating. The flavors were so unique and different. But wait, they weren’t finished yet, there was more. It was the Hanger Skirt Steam Gnocchi, which consisted of gnocchi marinated in a lemon garlic sauce and a mushroom gravy with pan fried cauliflower and carrot sauce. The gnocchi was so flavorful and soft. This is my second must have of the night when you visit. Lastly, the chef surprised us with Marinated Short Rib. The short rib was marinated in a sweet teriyaki sauce on top of a bed of white sticky rice and topped with sesame seeds and scallions. This is not always on the menu and I could immediately see why. Anyone who tried this would order it EVERY time. It was sweet and sticky and the rice soaked up all that amazing flavor. Wow! While chef Ben offered to make me a main one of their popular steaks, I had to turn him down. We were stuffed and didn’t even finish a few dishes. After they offered dessert we conceded to try two. They brought out choco babka balls made from homemade chocolate babka under a peanut sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The second was a creme brûlée topped with a red wine cranberry sauce and a side of ice cream. Both were amazing. I am a big fan of crème brûlée and this one didn’t let down. Perfect top to crack and sweet and silky on bottom with a delicious that’s red wine cranberry sauce… wow! I couldn’t get enough. If you haven’t been to Butcher Grill House, get yourself over and see what the hype is about!"

Truly, if I didn’t promise to share it with DH, that would have been my meal! Abso fabulous. Crispy croissant, luscious juicy beef and the guac added an additional unctuous note. It was a wonderful bite. DH ordered the grilled prime rib 22 ounces- done to medium very nicely, of which I divested him of a portion. Really good, and the fries were excellent and thick cut. Our friends chose the Delmonico steak (he’s been a number of times and it’s his favorite) but he insists on well done so I don’t even try to share. It looked good despite that. She went with the gnocchi and gave me a bite to taste- very good and a little different. No room for dessert! All in all a very nice meal."
