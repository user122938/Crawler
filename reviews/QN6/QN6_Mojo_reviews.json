            "text": "I've been here 3 times—first time was beginning of covid when they had their outdoor space. I enjoyed it a lot, and looked forward to returning. 2nd time was for brunch—I can't remember what I ordered, but I do remember that it was pretty standard, and nothing really stood out. 3rd time however, I ordered 3 appetizers, and my wife and I each ordered an entree. EVERYTHING was ridiculously salty: the tostada, shrimp tacos, cevice, jumpin lomo, and ropa vieja—all over-salted. We barely touched any of the food, and notified our server that the salt content made everything inedible, but she practically shrugged her shoulders, and seemed apathetic; no recourse; no offers to replace any of the food, and even asked if we wanted to-go boxes. It's a shame because it was amazing the first time."

Nothing crazy about it.\n\nNext, our entrees were decent, the drinks were great! The blackberry margarita was superb! A highlight of the night.\n\nWhat wasn't a highlight was not having a waitress after receiving our food. She basically disappeared.  We had to grab the bartenders attention who was nice about it but it did leave us with a sour taste. When we received our bill, a $20 tip was automatically added to our bill.\n\nTips are based on service and shouldnt be added automatically for a party of two. For the waitress to have ghosted us, have us wait for a while for the check, to then automatically add the tip. It wasnt worth it.\n\nIf you want a great Latin Cuisine place, I suggest going elsewhere. This used to be the spot especially during covid times and a bit after but its not the same anymore."

From the moment you step inside, the ambiance is undeniably beautiful, evoking the feeling of being in a lush, exotic country, setting the perfect stage for an unforgettable meal.\n\nThe culinary journey at Mojo is nothing short of exceptional. We indulged in a variety of dishes, and each one impressed. The cocktails were a fantastic start; we ordered two, and they were not only delicious but also commendably strong, perfectly setting the mood for the evening. The appetizers were truly excellent and bursting with flavor, showcasing the kitchen's mastery of Latin American cuisine. As for the main meals, they were, quite simply, insanely good – we were genuinely blown away by the incredible taste and authenticity.\n\nWhile the experience is rich in flavor and atmosphere, it's worth noting the pricing. Expect to spend around $150 for two, which we found to be a fair price given the high quality of the dishes, the delightful drinks, and the immersive ambiance.\n\nOne practical consideration for diners is parking. It can be quite challenging to find parking directly around the restaurant. However, there are convenient paid parking options available near the nearby Target, making it manageable to access this culinary gem.\n\nMojo is a standout Latin American restaurant that delivers on all fronts: exquisite dishes, potent cocktails, a stunning tropical ambiance, and a fair price point for the quality offered. Despite the minor parking hurdle, it's a highly recommended destination for anyone seeking a flavorful escape in Forest Hills."

The chips were strong and did not break when dipping them in which is a plus.  The appetizer came out quick, and the service was well paced for the most part.  Our waitress checked in with us throughout the meal to make sure everything was alright.  I ordered the burger with no ketchup cooked at medium rare, and it came out overcooked.  That said, they took it back right away and brought out another burger that was cooked to my liking.  On top of that, they also gave an additional portion of fries which I appreciated.  When they brought out the second burger, I think they forgot that I did not want the ketchup because it was on there.  I was still able to enjoy the burger as it was cooked well and the toppings (eggs caramelized onion) were able to partially distract me from the ketchup.  I was also able to try some of the fried rice that my peer ordered which was delicious; when coming back, I think I would order this because they gave a nice hearty portion as well.  I did not try any drinks, but they seemed to have a good selection.  The place was a little loud for me, but I can’t really fault them for that as there was live music being played; it was also a popular hour.  I appreciate that they made sure we had a good experience in the end.  Before we left, they offered a dessert on the house; I chose the passion fruit cheesecake and it was great.  It came with a nice side of what seemed like passion fruit jam which complimented the cake very well.  Overall, this meal satisfied me and I was happy with my experience.  The workers definitely care about the customer experience which goes a long way."

Now let’s talk about the food—chef’s kiss! The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the French toast was so fluffy and flavorful, it didn’t even need syrup.

It was not only the setting for my very first date with my now-fiancé, but also the incredible place where I planned and pulled off our engagement—flawlessly on August 23, thanks in huge part to the amazing team.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was pure magic. Warm, intimate lighting, elegant decor, and a vibe that strikes the perfect balance between upscale and welcoming. The food? Absolutely phenomenal. We started with amazing appetizers and every bite was bursting with flavor. Our mains were cooked to perfection—especially the churrasco—and the tres leche? Let’s just say, it was the cherry on top of a perfect night.\n\nBut what made the evening unforgettable was the incredible staff, especially Billy the manager. Billy went above and beyond helping me plan the proposal down to the smallest detail. From arranging the perfect table to timing everything just right—he was an absolute legend. Thanks to his help, the surprise went off without a hitch, and it was even more beautiful than I imagined.\nIf you’re looking for a place that combines top-tier cuisine, exceptional service, and the kind of atmosphere that turns moments into lifelong memories—Mojo restaurant is it. Whether it's your first date or the moment you ask someone to marry you, this is the place to do it.\n\nThank you again, Billy and the entire team.

I am in the customer service so I look out for customer service accommodations. The food was very good and fulfilling. I had the shrimp tacos with a side of yellow rice. The food was really good. The atmosphere was just as calm and welcoming and easy going. They actually give you your space and time to enjoy here at Mojo. I also found this place off til tok so this place was a great find! I definitely recommend this place and will come back here."

            "text": "I had two wonderful experiences at Mojo in August 2025, and both visits were nothing short of excellent.\n\nOn Saturday, August 23rd, 2025, I stopped by to ask if I could place an order in advance. One of the hosts, Emily, kindly explained that it wasn’t possible but shared a very helpful tip: the restaurant tends to be busy on Fridays and Saturdays due to Forest Hills Stadium concert events, while Mondays through Thursdays are much less crowded. She also patiently walked me through the vegetarian and vegan options, even pointing out which vegetarian dishes could be made vegan. Her thoughtful explanation convinced me to plan my visit for a weekday instead of the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 26th, 2025, I returned and was served by Delaney, who was incredibly friendly and energetic. She even asked whether I wanted my dishes served together or separately. Since I wanted to take a photo for my Google Maps review, I asked for both dishes to be served at the same time. I ordered the black bean burger (made vegan) and the Mojo vegan ceviche, along with a side salad instead of fries. When it came time to pay, Delaney helpfully explained that the tip was already included in the payment system, ensuring full transparency. I really appreciated that level of honesty and clear communication.\n\nAs for the food—absolutely delicious. Everything was fresh, beautifully prepared, and exactly how I requested for my vegan diet. Mojo is now my top recommendation for anyone looking for vegetarian or vegan options in a warm, welcoming environment.\n\nIf you love good food, great service, and a place that truly values its customers, Mojo is a must-visit."

They seated us quickly in a spacious area and were super patient with all our requests. The Latin fusion menu is fantastic—the adults loved the specialty tacos and frozen drinks, and the kids devoured the empanadas and the delicious churros for dessert. The atmosphere is lively and buzzing, which made us feel comfortable with the little ones making a bit of noise. It truly was a seamless, fun, and flavorful brunch experience. Highly recommend Mojo"

Our waitress, Daniela, was exceptional – truly attentive and went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time. We started with the highly-rated Calamari, which lived up to the hype. For our mains, we enjoyed the Chicken Maduro Waffles, the Poblano Chicken Sandwich, and the standout Mojo Burger. The Mojo Burger was incredibly satisfying, packed with protein and served with a generous portion of fries. Adding a dash of hot sauce elevated it even further. I highly recommend Mojos, especially with Daniela's excellent service, and will definitely be bringing friends and family back!"
