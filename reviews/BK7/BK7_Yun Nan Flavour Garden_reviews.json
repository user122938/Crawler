For the noodles, the meat given for the braised chicken was very little and although there was a lot of noodles, the soup flavoring had a strong pepper taste to it. The aftertaste of the soup was really weird, so I personally do not recommend ordering this. The customer service attitude was also really lacking. This was especially obvious when a nonasian person came into the store. They immediately served the person with a glass of cold water and a plate of appetizer, which my table of 4 people did not get. The attitude they gave the nonasian person was much more pleasing and complient, while their attitude with my table was very nonchalant. I would say the food is decent enough for the price, but I would not come again.\n\nRice noodles with braised chicken - $8.5\nDumplings with Hot & Sour Sauce - $8.25"

I cannot find this flavor anywhere else!! I love every single dish here but especially the zhajiang mi xian (no soup version), the sour spicy dumplings, and the pork intestine noodles. 😍 this place has to be on my list of top 10 favorite noodles."

They really need to hire a better person to translate their menu into English properly though...\n\n#9 Rice Noodle w/ Lu Mein 滷米線 $8.25\nThe first one is dry noodle with braised pork and cilantro, and it was right up my alley with its flavorful sauce. Few months ago you def won't catch me eating cilantro, but now I have higher acceptance of its pungent taste. I added some chilli oil yet it wasn't spicy enough and only gave a slight numbing sensation.\n\n#11 Rice Noodle w/ Crispy Meat Sauce 脆腸米線 $8.75\nThe second bowl is rice noodle soup with crispy pork intestine. I don't eat intestines, but my company had high praise on them, saying they were clean and crispy.\n\nTheir rice noodles were perfectly cooked and carried a bouncy texture. We were surprised that we didn't feel thirsty after slurping the entire bowl, which means their rice noodles weren't salty and didn't have MSG."

All of the ingredients come separately. Then the server will add the items to extremely hot broth in a particular order. The broth feels very refreshing.\n\nThe service here is very inefficient. It's typical in Chinese restaurants to get attention only when you ask for it but this place is so slow. They constantly got orders wrong. It's clear there's no process and no clearly defined roles. You need to be aggressive to get everything"

            "text": "On a rare occasion we decided to explore the original Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park despite the horrific BQE congestion. After traversing the entire length of 8th Ave within the Chinatown, we ended up here for a light meal. Yunnan is a province in southern China, bordering the Southeast Asian countries.  So it’s no surprise that its signature noodle dishes are reminiscent of Vietnamese pho. Yep, that’s my impression anyway after trying their menu item #1, Crossing The Bridge Rice Noodle $12.\n\nIt’s like pho, the broth is clear but more gingery, the rice noodle is round - not flat, the proteins shredded instead of whole slices.  The takeout version came with 2 separate big containers of broth one of which is a souped up chicken broth.  I found it quite odd but Not complaining.  I think I was supposed to mix them into the same bowl, but I simply dunk rice noodle into one and never get to the second broth as I’d finished the rice noodle.  I ended up drinking the second broth on my next meal.  Both broth were beyond delicious. The proteins were way too little however.  The rice noodle had a unique and intriguing texture.\n\nMy family also tried #3 - the beef & lamb version of #1 for $2 more, #5 - Rice Noodle with Beef Stew $8.50, and #14 Noodle with Lamb Stew $9.25. From what I gathered, I would recommend the latter 2 even though they are not their signature soups. They came with noticeably more protein and thus much better value."
