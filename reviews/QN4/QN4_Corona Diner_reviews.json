And the fact the food that I did eat was good.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of regular mac & cheese as an appetizer and oh my, it was really good.  Hot & bubbly and cheesy just the way I like it.  They have many different types of mac and cheese but for me I prefer regular mac & cheese. This place delivered on that.  & for that they get an extra star!\n\nI ordered a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and what I didn't realize was that it said served with coleslaw. I didn't realize that the coleslaw would actually be on the sandwich and I think that's where I went wrong. So maybe it's my fault. However the chicken sandwiche was a bit too salty for my liking. I got tater tots with my order and the tater tots or were very hot &crisp and tasted really good. my cousin got a steak sandwich and my other cousin got French toast. She did order chocolate chip French toast and when the order arrived it was regular French toast she didn't say anything and she just kept the French toast she was given. I didn't taste some french toast but she said it was good.\n\nI noticed the guy was making some shakes and it seems that this place is known for their shakes but what I did notice was that they were using a frosting to frost a glass. And that's the thing that I don't like about places that make those signature shakes, is that they do use frosting just to make it look nice and I'm just not a fan of that."

This happen after 45 mins of sitting down, I had to ask the server for my appetizer other wise nothing would had come out, 50 mins passed and no food came out, Most of the time everyone was more concern about their friends who were sitting in the bar and some tables than taking care of the customer.
