We have no regrets about choosing this old fashioned Tex-Mex Restaurant, the food was delicious and VERY friendly staff. Love their traditions of serving soup as appetizer and flan/cake for desserts.

Well, no tasted horrible like flutas soaked in green sause, and a lot of white cheese melted. she took them back to remake, but it was still done the same and yet less chicken, so it was like the corn tortilla by itself. idk was still not freshly made and very sour. The mexican rice was bad tasted like if it was cooked with re-used oil that was cooked for fish because it tasted like Marisco/seafood the mashed beans tasted Burned like when they get burned and they add more beans to the pan to try and cover their mistakes yet it transfers the burnt taste through the food. The 2nd plate was milanesa. Yes, it's a huge piece, but it has too much nerve/ligament cooked that it was like Jerky Very hard and tough, meat is not cleaned well. And yet the rice again has the same fishy taste. So yeah, it was a NO. Prestintation is there"

I usually go for the enchilada plates at Mexican restaurants but this time decided to try something different - I had the puerco asado and my friend had the enchiladas! I didn’t get a pic because I ate mine too fast. It was that good! I can’t wait to come back."

The 2.99 taco i got was the size of a sincroizada. The menudo packed seasoning, but some added salt, pepper, onion, and limon really boosted it to a, delicious level. The tortillas de maiz were casera style and excellent.  Definitely a must place to visit. I wish i lived in Brownsville to frequent it more."

            "text": "Great, authentic Mexican food in Brownsville!  I had the cheese enchiladas Mexican-style (which I think meant a spicy red chile sauce).  I got four rolled enchiladas with sprinkled white cheese on top.  The sauce was the best part as I could taste the flavor of true red chile, which is common in New Mexico but very hard to find in Texas for whatever reason.  The enchiladas were delicious and accompanied by rice and some of the best refried beans I've ever had.  Order your meal with a Mexican Coke and you'll soon be in a happy food coma.\n\nEven though we had a large party, our service was excellent.  I highly recommend this place for anyone in Brownsville looking for top notch Mexican food; it was better than anything I've had in San Antonio and that's saying a lot.  My only complaint was the enchiladas themselves were lukewarm but that could have been because of the size of our large group."

I love Machacado a la Mexicana con Todo, but with their enormous flour tortillas instead of corn. The Huevos con Chorizo Taco is a monster and super-tasty! Very good prices and a clean establishment.\n\nGringos Beware: It does help to know Spanish here when ordering. But the wait staff here is so patient and will work through any language barrier to get you what you want."
