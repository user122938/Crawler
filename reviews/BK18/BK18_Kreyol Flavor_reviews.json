I made an order online while I was 15 minutes out from the location. It said it will take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes for my order to be complete. Upon arrival at the location, my order was still not ready. I stood in the store for about 20 minutes additional minutes while they completed my order. When I receive my food, one of the items that I ordered was not correct forcing me to go back in and spend another 15 minutes while they corrected my order. By that time, my appetite had already gone, but I had already paid as well so what choice did we have? To proceed when I begin eating my food, the macaroni salad, unfortunately was flavorless. The fish I can say was great. The turkey was not as expected and lacked flavor. The service at the location was par. And unfortunately, I do not feel like it was worth my time, travel, or money."

However I'm not Haitian and when my Haitian sister-in-law tried it, she said it was lacking acid. It came with a good portion of rice and a side and 2 pieces of fried bannann. The fried bannann was too thick, not crispy enough and not salty enough.\n\nMy Haitian husband had the patties. However these patties don't look like any Haitian patty I have ever seen or tasted and we've been together almost 20 years. They look more like gigantic empanadas with creative fillings (like a whole boiled egg). He can't even say if they at least tasted good because he can't get over the shock of finding a boiled egg in the filling.\n\nThe service was terribly, terribly slow...and it was around 2:30 in the afternoon on a Monday."

Literally all they need to do is scooping the food into the container. And honestly the food isn’t that good. The chicken is so dry. And the pork is so hard to chew. I wouldn’t even go here a second time if it’s not so close to me.\n\nToday I decided to give it another try. The cashier got my order wrong. I told her and she just brushed me off and started talking to the next customer.\n\nI’m never going back again."
