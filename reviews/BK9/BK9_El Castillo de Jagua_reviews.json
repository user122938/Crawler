The Dominican restaurant Melanie down the block has the same thing for about $5 less. Very disappointed. I’ve been to this place about 3 times and I can say each time I haven’t been satisfied.

Some servers will give you healthy portions while other will give you the minimum. One server told me I was rude because I asked for more portions in my order.\nI don't order or pickup anymore because of this lady.\nFast forward til after the New Year and I tried to order again.They took my order then said \"oh if you called 1 second earlier we could have delivered but as of 1 second ago we stopped doing deliveries\" as he was laughing"

To top it off, they didn't give is any utensils and napkins. I had to ask for that too. Then when I asked some guy for a few green sauces, his attitude was disgusting. He very nastily respond, \"HOW MUCH YOU WANT??\" Disgusting attitude, like I was bothering him. And I only asked him because our own waitress kept on disappearing for 20 minutes at a time. Lastly, my friend ordered a papaya shake in the beginning when we ordered our drinks. She didn't receive it till about 10 minutes before we left.
