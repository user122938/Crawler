The large plate was 22$ but my partner and I shared it and it was definitely e oh for the both of us. It comes with veggies, rice and peas and bananas. Veggies were crunchy and the perfect touch to balance out the meat. The rice and peas were plentiful and bananas were cooked fresh.  We also ordered a beef patty it was 3$ and had a nice spicy kick to it."

Parking was easy but hey it’s NYC so double park if you feel like it. This picture was just my food which was the oxtails DELICIOUS and SO TENDER! It was cooked to perfection and had so much seasoning and the gravy was yum yum. The plantains were sweet and good as well. I also got a side of yellow cake with my food which reminded me of cornbread but smoother and sweeter. My family order the curry goat which they said was the best they ever had. They also ordered some stew which they double backed for. The prices are very reasonable! Oh bring cash because that’s all they take but if not there is an ATM inside. Customer service could have been a little better but it didn’t stop me from giving them 5stars"
