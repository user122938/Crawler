From the moment we arrived, it felt as though the level of attention depended on how much one was willing to spend.\n\nThe hostess informed us of a minimum spend per person, which we understood, but her manner of redirecting us to the bar after we mentioned we were only there for drinks came across as dismissive and unwelcoming. Unfortunately, that tone continued at the bar, where the bartender showed little enthusiasm or courtesy.\n\nFor the prices they charge, the drinks were underwhelming and did not reflect the quality one would expect from a place of this caliber. The only redeeming feature was the view: breathtaking, but not enough to make up for the poor service.\n\nOverall, it’s a beautiful setting overshadowed by an uninviting atmosphere. I wouldn’t return, nor would I recommend it unless significant improvements are made to the service and hospitality."

I didn’t know about a minimum spend of $150 (it was $75 during the day and says that on the booking site) until I arrived. The staff was ok but then at the end of the night, we kept getting warnings that they were closing soon at 11. That’s normal and I get it. At 10:55, a guy comes and grabs the light off of our table and says “sorry guys. We’re closing in like 2 minutes”. We were left sitting in the dark. Then on the receipt, there’s a big line for tip but in very small print, it says. 20% gratuity is already taken. I had to ask the waitress to confirm this. It wasn’t made clear from at any other point. 2 stars because the view is incredible."

I’m clearly there to spend. I told her I was checking it out online and wanted to be seated.

            "text": "We had a reservation for two at Harriet’s Rooftop, and unfortunately, the experience did not meet expectations. Upon arrival, no one greeted us at the entrance, and we had to wait around 15 minutes before the host showed up. When she finally arrived, she was extremely arrogant and dismissive. We mentioned that we were celebrating my birthday and asked if it would be possible to sit by the window. She told us that those tables were reserved for groups of four, yet later in the evening we saw two separate tables by the window with only two guests each. This felt dishonest and left a very negative impression.\n\nWe also ordered a cake, and since we had informed them it was my birthday, we naturally expected at least a small gesture, such as a candle. Shockingly, there was nothing — and my brother had to remind the staff twice before we finally received a candle. For a restaurant of this category, where guests celebrate special occasions, this lack of attention is simply unacceptable.\n\nAlthough our waitress was kind and attentive, the food was mediocre and the drinks were just average — nothing special. For a place with a minimum spend of $150 per person, one would expect much higher standards both in service and in quality. We spent around $350 in total, but the overall experience was far from worth it.\n\nIn summary, apart from the nice view and the polite waitress, there was little to justify the high prices or the minimum spend. Service, honesty, and food quality fell short of expectations. Sadly, I cannot recommend Harriet’s Rooftop and would only rate it 2 out of 5 stars."

It made little sense to sit on a rooftop in the pouring rain, and getting there on time became impossible.\n\nWe called the venue three times before our reservation to cancel, but no one ever picked up. On the last attempt, we left a voicemail explaining the situation. Despite this, at 19:10 we noticed a $50 “missed reservation” fee charged to our card, even though our booking was for 19:30.\n\nSince then, I’ve tried reaching out several times by phone and email, but have received no response.\n\nBe cautious booking here. If it rains, you may find yourself forced to either sit on the rooftop in bad weather or risk being charged a fee for not showing up, even after trying to cancel in advance."

Overall, a wonderful experience—I’ll definitely be back!\n\nRooms are all brand new and updated with filtered water tap in the room! They are small but also standard for the area.  Very clean and the room feel larger with the huge windows.  Amazing views for the upgraded room.\n\nHotel staff was so accommodating and helpful.  They also have a courtesy car to take you around.

We had a reservation for 8 and we were prepared to meet the min spend requirement ($75pp).\nThe issue arose when two friends stopped by briefly with their baby to say goodbye, something I had proactively cleared with the hostess. However, when the parents sat with us at the existing table, the server announced they would be added to the minimum spend.\n\nI explained that I had already cleared it with the hostess downstairs. We would have been open to alternatives that met us halfway; instead, she then doubled down, claiming that since they had ordered a drink, they would be added to the minimum spend of $150/person (as it was after 4 pm). We were put in the uncomfortable position of asking the parents to leave with their baby shortly after they arrived, which felt unnecessarily cold and harsh.\n\nAt one point, our server made a snide remark when we wanted to order some snacks, and towards the end, we were given a countdown to meet our spend, even though the venue was mostly empty (photo attached).\n\nIt was clear the venue was singularly focused on making money. I understand policies exist, but there was a clear lack of empathy, especially toward parents with a baby and a group celebrating a special occasion. A bit of discretion would have gone a long way. I had originally wanted to raise these points privately, and I sent the venue and the GM emails and called the venue directly. Alas, only for my outreach to be completely ignored."

La vue était moins belle que ce que j'avais imaginé, et l'établissement était mal entretenu. Les photos sur Instagram et Google ne reflétaient pas du tout la réalité. Les banquettes et le bois du bar étaient anciens, secs et grisâtres, sans aucun vernis ni entretien.

            "text": "I recently had the pleasure of dinning and having drinks  at a stunning rooftop at 1 hotel in NYC, and it exceeded all expectations—not just because of the breathtaking skyline views, but thanks to the incredible service we received from one of the servers, Mike.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, Mike made us feel like VIPs. His warm demeanor, attention to detail, and genuine enthusiasm for ensuring we had a great experience stood out. Whether it was recommending the perfect cocktail, checking in to make sure everything was just right, or sharing insider tips about the city, Mike went above and beyond.\n\nThe rooftop ambiance was lively yet relaxed, with panoramic views that perfectly captured the magic of New York City. But it was Mike’s outstanding service that truly elevated our evening and made it memorable.\n\nIf you’re looking for a hotel that combines luxury, views, and exceptional hospitality, this is it—and if you’re lucky enough to be served by Mike, you’re in for an unforgettable experience!"

The ambiance was fantastic, but it was the view that truly stole the show – absolutely amazing.\n\nThe rolls we ordered were nothing short of delicious; they were a perfect blend of flavors and textures that left us craving for more. However, what truly set this dining experience apart was the exceptional service. Jonathan, our server, was attentive and made sure we were comfortable throughout the meal. He constantly checked on us, ensuring that our needs were met promptly.\n\nOur waitress and the rest of the staff were equally outstanding, going out of their way to make our visit enjoyable. The wait, though longer than expected, was definitely worth it considering the impeccable service and the breathtaking view.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. The combination of amazing food, a stunning view, and top-notch service make it a must-visit destination. We'll definitely be returning soon!"

We made a group reservation, but the host seemed careless, and the staff didn’t show much attention to the guests. The last call for food was around 7 p.m., and they closed the rooftop by 9 p.m., even though we hadn’t finished our meal. The staff was already prepping to clean the table, which felt rushed. The drinks were expensive, and the food was just okay. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend it, especially since you can find other restaurants nearby with a similar view."

That was for me not satisfied because the service did not serve the drinks only when we was asking again and again. That’s why I let removed the high service fee.\nOne nice tip visit the restrooms guys"

A la hora de autorizar el pago, te suman todo lo que no hayas consumido pero lo peor es que los 150 usd son POR PERSONA y eso no lo aclaran.\n\nSumado a eso, el servicio es malo, la comida no es buena, las bebidas te las dan en vaso/copa de plastico. En una noche despejada no son capaces de correr las sombrillas para tener una vista despejada.\n\nEl lugar es realmente desastroso, lo unico que vale la pena es la vista (siempre y cuando te toque en una buena ubicacion). No recomiendo a nadie cenar en este lugar, es tan malo que te arruinan la noche o incluso las vacaciones."

It was a bit difficult trying to get a bartender to serve us since it didn’t seem like there were any. It was not nice for the waiter to say that there was a minimum spending limit after sitting at the table. At the end of the day, we paid $750 bills. We've already come to have fun and of course we will eat and drink something. However, it’s definitely a beautiful hotel and has a wonderful atmosphere."

            "text": "Have a mixed reaction writing this review as our initial experience was terrible but then it got better.\nNot sure if it was a miscommunication thing or what but originally we were told that the rooftop has no seatings and just a place to go up and enjoy the view. Was told the only way to enjoy the view was to get a table with a minimum bill of $75 / person. We were a party of 4. We decided to get the last walk in table even thought we clearly said we’re here just for drinks.\nGot to the table which was mediocre and hot. Waited and waited and no service. The host that took us to the table said we could bring our drinks to the rooftop. After long wait, went back to the reception and this time they said we can’t take our drinks to the rooftop and that actually there’s a bar on the roof; just no food. It’s first come first serve.\n\nWe luckily was able to give up our table and went to the rooftop which was what we originally came here for. Found lots of available seatings to enjoy the spectacular view of NYC. Even had a nice bar with super friendly bartenders serving nice drinks. Vibe and decor was excellent with good beats playing. Ended up with a bar tab of $260 for about 11 drinks which was costly but then well worth it with the view. Bartender clearly said gratuity 20% was already included.\n\nSuggest the hotel to have better instructions for the restaurant reception on how to welcome guest. Don’t try to trick them in having to get a table. Either have the rooftop bar open to the public or make it as hotel guest only area."
