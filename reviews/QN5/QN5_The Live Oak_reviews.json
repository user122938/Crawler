The menu had so many amazing options that we couldn’t decide what to order, so we ended up getting a variety of dishes and everything was delicious. The drinks were outstanding as well. Victoria’s attentive and friendly service made the whole experience memorable. Highly recommend this place. We’ll definitely be back!"

I am partial to Xee and Allison because I used to work with those superstars, but I have never gone in there and had a bad experience with any other staffer.\n\nI am reviewing now, however, because they are offering takeout during the quarantine, and I just wanted to thank them publicly for it.  All the delivery guys have been so sweet, so kind, working in dangerous conditions but never letting it show in their attitude. The resilience and commitment is so admirable----I can't wait for all this to be over so Brandon and I can be jerks about the jukebox and drink with our maspeth buddies. It has renewed my commitment  to spend money locally. Hang in there, Live Oak! We love you! Thank you, and be safe!"
