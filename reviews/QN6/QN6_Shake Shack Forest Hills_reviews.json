The Cookies flavor is absolutely the best (sorry, Oreo fans!). I’ve already made all my friends fall in love with it too. Everything here is always clean, quick, and delicious. The team is super friendly — if you don’t understand something or feel like you’ve been waiting too long, they’ll always explain and help with a smile. Thank you, guys! You’re amazing — I’ll definitely be back! 🍪🍔🥤"

Will visit again when in the area.\n\nI wish there were more cashiers instead of self-serve kiosks. The human interaction makes all the difference. Shake Shack's mood lighting is a nice touch. This location is open until *very* late daily, a much-appreciated rarity for the neighborhood.\n\nThe mushroom burger is delicious! The fries are pretty good as well, with or without cheese. That said, the cheese sauce tastes great for fast food. I ordered the 'shroom burger with cheese fries, no drink for ~ $18.\n\nTheir special milkshakes sounded good and must go fast because they were sold out by nighttime."

It's one of the more pricier burger joints but it's definitely worth it's money in service, quality and overall vibe. I can always come around to any location and expect high shelf service and it's no exception over to where I went. Best Smashburgers in the game, nice tender chicken with the right amount of crisp, fries that could possibly beat out McDonald's in the taste test and nobody is touching the shakes because they own that department. It's just comforting that no matter which location you go to, the service is gonna be as consistent and precise, as well as the food being incredible."
