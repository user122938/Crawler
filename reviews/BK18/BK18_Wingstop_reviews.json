My go-to flavor is Lemon Pepper — it’s the perfect mix of tangy and salty — but honestly, you can’t go wrong with any of them. The Louisiana Rub and Mango Habanero are also top-tier if you like a little kick.\n\nTheir fries are underrated too — that sweet, seasoned flavor is addicting. The ranch? Easily the best fast-food ranch out there. Service is usually quick, and everything comes out fresh, even when it’s busy.\n\nOverall, Wingstop is my go-to spot when I’m craving wings that actually taste fresh and have real flavor. Definitely worth every bite!"

I also like the way how they still make a way to get to customers who come in to order instead of pushing us to the side for DoorDash services. They make sure everyone gets good service.\n\nLocation(1114 Flatlands Ave)\nService guest: (10008)"

I dont eat their chicken anything… I’ve had the Corn on the cob once before ( introduced by my sister) corn was fresh and tasty - which was the reason I ordered 8/27/25. Horrible experience! Corn on the cob was NOT FRESH, OVER COOKED, OVER SEASONED and SOGGY! Entire order went in the trash. I was so disappointed and dissatisfied. I will NEVER ORDER from Wingstop again! I wouldn’t be surprised if the doors are closing soon for this fast food restaurant. ✌🏾"

I thought I was going to be cheese and bacon, instead they were fries with cheese and blue cheese and I felt I had discovered a new continent oh and the cheese wasn’t the melted slice cheese other places put in your fries. This melted cheese is legit.\n\nThe service was good, the lady helping us was nice, had a genuine smile, she even made suggestions and explained the menu (something you rarely see it nowadays).\n\nThe environment does work and not because of the staff, they had the place CLEANED and ORGANIZED, it’s more from the ownership/management side as there only so much the staff can do, but for the location I would say it blends in.\n\nOverall..\n5 stars on the food.\n5 stars on the service.\n5 stars on the cleanliness.\n3 start environment (needs love from the franchise level)."
