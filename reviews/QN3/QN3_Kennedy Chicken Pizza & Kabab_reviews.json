They only take orders from GrubHub, Doordash, Uber, and Slice. I had to download GrubHub. The order from Menufy didn't print in their phones and ipads they had in the store. I wish they had told me that 2 other times they had done this before, I could had downloaded GrubHub before and didn't have to face all these problems. I had to go to the store and show them my receipt which said the food is ready but had to wait more longer when I got to the store.\n\nEdit: New rules I guess that the food cost is different from cash and card. One of the cashier refused to take my order because he didn't understand me. Menu price is different from Doordash and at the store. Sign outside said $4.99 medium size pizza but nowhere does it say it's cash or card.\n\nThe complaint is reported to the Better Business Bureau."

Third day they said they have to see what I ordered on my phone because they don't use the app for taking orders.

Their Afghan food is good, not the best out there but it's better then the most. Their fried chicken & burgers are great! I've since placed my order with them 5 more times & Shafi has always delivered my food hot & fresh.\nI dont know who were the other delivery guys that made people write negative reviews. If you want to place an order for delivery, I suggest you call the store & request Shafi for delivery because he truly is a nice guy.\nHope this helps future customers with their delivery orders.

The food they make looks nothing like the ones they advertise. (2.) The food isn't fresh at all , it's like they saved it on the fridge  for 7 days and then just placed it into the microwave and sell it like that( 3). I found a hair on my chicken wing , which was disgusting by the way! (4.) The  next morning I woke up with a puffy eye due to the high amount of sodium they used on the food and no it wasn't becuase of allergies I'm not allergic to anything . (5). They can also use a little more of cleaning on the place ... PS: I usually never take my time to leave reviews but I really felt like I had to warn people of this disgusting place .Don't buy food here!! You'll regeret it."
