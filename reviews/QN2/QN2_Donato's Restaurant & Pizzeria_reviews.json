He does the bare minimum and actually seems annoyed if you ask him anything.. He never brought us any bread until we asked, and when it did come, it was stale.. He barely came near us the rest of the time.. We ordered a shrimp appetizer and it had 3 Shrimp on a pathetic piece of old lettuce.  Presentation very poor, and for 2 people I feel 4 Shrimp would have been appreciated.  My main issue is with this waiter.  He does not provide good friendly service and brings down the atmosphere of the place.. He clearly is unhappy here, so I strongly suggest he go elsewhere! He is also rude to children. My 16 year old daughter sat with her friend  here outside  in August and ordered a full meal in 90 degree heat. She asked for water wuth her meal, and he never brought her water to drink. Seriously? It is common practice here that water is brought out immediately once ordered or even before the order...Totally unacceptable.  I will say the owners here are lovely, and the young lady that brought us out waters etc.was lovely. Again, this server brings the whole place down."

They were hard and cold after they gave them to me after being in the oven for like 6 min. So my only guess is that they were at least 1 day old or from when they first opened. I went around 6 pm. I had them before, and I specifically asked for light ones. They tend to be softer and moist. So yeah, I had to throw them away after inspecting every single one and trying them by biting into it. Was left sad b3cause I was looking forward to really good ones. I've tried many  and from different places. Again, if you enjoy bread and specifically garlic knots....this place is not it.🤷🏻‍♀️ sorry."
