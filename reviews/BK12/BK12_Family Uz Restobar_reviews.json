The borscht completely spilled, and the sushi that was placed underneath became warm and spoiled. The whole order arrived in terrible condition — it honestly looked like something taken from the trash.\n\nThis was an unacceptable experience. I truly hope the restaurant pays more attention to proper packaging and food quality in the future."
