I think for their prices their portions can be bigger. But the food was tasty. We also had limonana and cheesecake that we enjoyed. Great kosher option in crown heights if you want dairy."

The food took a long time to come out and when it arrived, the flavors were unbalanced. We ordered the pesto pasta, which was not cooked to the right degree and the sauce was unbalanced. The pizza dough was not of high quality and the sauce did not live up to expectations. There was no atmosphere or music in the background. I heard every word the workers said in the kitchen and the waiters. Regarding the price, the price was not terrible and was very reasonable. I have heard good things about the place lately, that it has changed and the food is excellent. Maybe I will give it another chance and update the review."

After 40 min, my brother asked what's going on, and the same waiter who assured me I had to wait patiently said, \"Oh actually, I never put it in the order!! He couldn't even come over to me too, sorry. It just shows how far down this place has gone. I would not go back here, nothing special except yesterday's food."

            "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant. The vibe is pretty cool, especially the back room, and for someone looking to get out of Flatbush, Crown Heights is ideal. Now let's get to the food. As the meal began, I was very impressed with most of the appetizers, but as more food came out and especially the mains, it was a little disappointing. We were a group of six, so we ordered plenty of different dishes so I got to taste almost the entire menu. The mozzarella sticks are really good. The shawarma tacos are interesting, but very enjoyable if you like middle Eastern food. The stuffed mushrooms were tasty but the portion was tiny. The cheese rice balls were delicious. Now for the mains... First off, we ordered two identical dishes of grilled salmon. One portion was absolutely stellar; cooked perfectly, and really high quality fish. The other one was dry and rubbery which was a real disappointment. The Chilean sea bass was excellent but quite small for a piece of fish that's $45. The seared tuna steak was just okay. Nothing great or memorable. And as my friend at AT&T likes to say \"Just ok is NOT okay\". ;) The truffle fries were delicious, as were the truffle mashed potatoes. As far as pasta goes, the fettuccine alfredo was excellent, however, the penne Rosa was terrible; really bland. We also had a vegetable pizza which was pretty good, but the pesto pizza was really not too impressive. The pesto was just drenched all over the pizza, and really ruined the texture, and made it all soggy and runny. We ordered an eggplant parmesan, but one of us took one bite and really didn't enjoy it, and it just sat there and we just left it untouched. It could be it was okay but we're just not eggplant parmesan people. We ordered it because it came highly recommended. As far as desserts go, the cheesecake is good, and the peanut butter souffle is great, but a little intense in terms of flavor. Very heavy on the peanut butter. The waffle is pretty good, but the crème brûlée was absolutely abysmal. I personally enjoy crème brûlée warm, but this one is cold, but that's just my personal preference. However the top was nearly inedible. It was just burnt crust that you couldn't really break. The milkshakes and coffee drinks are decent, but nothing to write home about. The plating and food design for all the dishes were stellar though. Overall, we had a nice time, some of the dishes were big hits, and others were big misses. It's definitely an expensive restaurant, so it was a little bit of a letdown but we still left pretty happy. We spent a little over $500 bucks for 5 adults and 1 child which in my opinion is definitely not \"cheap\" for a dairy restaurant, so I was sort of hoping for a little bit more of the \"wow\" factor. But, it's quite hard to get everything perfect, and and they got a lot right. The food came out swiftly, and the service was very good too. Attached below are photos of most of the dishes we ordered."
