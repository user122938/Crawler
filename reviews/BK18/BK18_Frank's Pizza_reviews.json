Also pizza box was touching floor and mosquitos was having a party all over in the place. Thanks to Frank pizza for this experience"

One of the standout items that keeps me coming back is their cheese steak fries—they’re next level. Perfectly crispy fries loaded with juicy steak, melted cheese, and just the right amount of seasoning. It’s comfort food done right.\n\nThe pizza here is great too—classic New York style with generous toppings and a delicious crust. The staff is friendly, the service is quick, and the atmosphere is welcoming whether you’re grabbing a quick bite or ordering for a group.\n\nIf you’re in the area, Frank’s Pizza at 8025 Flatlands Ave is definitely worth a visit. Don’t leave without trying the cheese steak fries—you’ll thank me later!"

            "text": "Terrible & deserves ZERO stars. Using the Sloce app, I ordered a large pepperoni with extra cheese, penne a la vodka, a calzone & pinwheels. This was my 2nd time trying this place after a mediocre initial taste & figured extra cheese might solve my problems. I’ve never owned a pizzeria, however, objectively, this place uses so little cheese on their pizza, that their extra cheese option, which costs $2, still doesn’t come close to a regular serving of cheese at other local pizzerias. After speaking with the people at slice, they confirmed that their vodka sauce is tomato sauce & heavy cream, which I personally find to be an affront to Italian cuisine everywhere. Naturally, the pasta also had very little “vodka” sauce & the added chicken was bland at best. If I had a nonna, she’d be appalled. The pinwheels also had a meager serving of cheese with maybe 3 pepperonis at the center? Lastly, the calzone had sausage that was bright red & the taste was reminiscent of school lunch circa 1998. The food this place serves is atrocious. Bring your business elsewhere."
