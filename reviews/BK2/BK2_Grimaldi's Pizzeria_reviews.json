It's a shame when you pick up that it's luke warm by the time you walk home (at best). We arrived right at the time they said it would be done and it was already ready to go. Fortunately they had it sitting in their warmer. It would be a nice touch if they notified you if it was done earlier.\n\nCrust was nice and crispy. Pizza sauce was really good. The dough had a really nice flavor.\n\nWould pick up again when craving pizza!\n\nCan’t comment on atmosphere Since we picked up. I know there is always a line when I walk by."

            "text": "Grimaldi’s serves traditional coal-fired brick oven pizza. This is the most famous Grimaldi’s location, right next door to its original location. I tried the Brooklyn Bridge, which comes with roasted red peppers, creamy ricotta, Italian sausage, mozzarella, and a tomato sauce base, and The Don, topped with Italian sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. The ricotta on the Brooklyn Bridge wasn’t really my thing, but The Don was delicious. I also had their red sangria, which was very refreshing, and finished off with the Oreo cheesecake for dessert. Highly recommend! They offer three pizza sizes: 12”, 16”, and 18”. We ordered two 18-inch pizzas to share between four people. Even though my friends were pretty hungry, we still ended up with leftovers. In hindsight, two 16-inch pizzas would’ve been the perfect amount. We went on a Saturday around 3 p.m. and waited about 30 minutes outside before being seated, so definitely expect a line if you visit on the weekend."

            "text": "The food was great! The service was terrible. And unfortunately bad service made for a bad experience.\n\nWe were sitting for around half an hour before anyone came over to take our order, and only then because we had to find a hostess and ask why no one would come to us. They said they thought we weren't ready, but we had been sitting with our menus closed (or occasionally just perusing) for a WHILE. And they should have at least come by to take our drink orders.\n\nThen, when they did bring our drink orders, they forgot the kids drinks.\n\nWe ordered three pizzas, and they only brought one (and it had been sitting for a while. Someone obviously made a mistake somewhere with our order). We had to remind them to bring the other two, and to bring the kids drinks... again.\n\nWe had the same experience when we were ready to leave. We told the guy repeatedly we didn't want dessert and were ready to leave, but he put dessert menus down in front of us anyway and walked away. We kept waiting for him to bring the check, or to try to get his attention, until I finally told everyone to just get up and put our coats on. This was maybe another half hour total, and I finally had to find someone and tell them our server wouldn't bring the check.\n\nAnd they kept trying to take our plates away while we were still eating! They couldn't at least ask if we were ready? We had to literally grab our plates back from people. If they were so eager to get us out of there quickly and flip the table, they shouldn't have made us sit and grumble while hungry for so long.\n\nIf they were just busy, that's one thing, but they clearly weren't attentive to our table at all. And we'd have been more understanding if they had said \"Sorry we're really behind,\" but instead they said \"Oh we didn't know you wanted to order\" and ignored us when we said we didn't want dessert and just wanted the check. That's not being busy, that's bad service."

To sum it up the place was dingy and dirty, the pizza was well done on top and doughy and under cooked on the bottom, the sauce had very little flavor. They used to drizzle a little olive oil on the pie before bringing it out, I guess they don't do that any more and the soda was flat. The only bright spot was the service, the waitress was very nice and attentive but even the good service is not enough to go back to this place. Double thumbs down for this place 👎👎🍕🍕"
