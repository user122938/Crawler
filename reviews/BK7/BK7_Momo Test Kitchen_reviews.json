Transportation wise, if you connect to the B11 bus, it's last stop will put you just 1 block away. The restaurant itself is very small with just a counterspace that will accomodate 8-9 people. What's really cool is that you can see the can kitchen staff busy preparing your meal. I had the bbq eel bowl & the eel avocado cucumber role, while my daughter had the salmon teriyaki bento box & spicy tuna role. They were all delicious & fresh tasting. There service was phenomenal & friendly. They also have some really tasty sauces. We had the ginger & spicy mayo. All in all it was worth the trip, just wish the place was bigger."

We were clearly confused talking about looking at the menu wondering if we were to order first and then sit down or sit down and order first. While we were asking her and about to place our order she welcomed another party in who clearly knew how to order. They sat and then ordered  with familiarity. The whole time she just ignored us and glared at us. We were waiting to order and the entire time she was extremely rude and refused to repeat our order total. We paid cash and she didn’t even confirm our total and the amount we gave her or even ask us if we were taking it go. She did not thank us for the order and even gave attitude when I asked for the receipt. This place is located in the annex of the Brooklyn Army Terminal and I believe most customers are employees working in the area. The rest of the staff seemed nice and created a nice atmosphere. Expect for this cashier she handed me the food and didn’t even say thank you. I caught her glaring multiple times. Decent prices for the area, next time would definitely come and sit down to directly talk to the other staff. She was wearing a sweater from one of the high schools in Brooklyn, and honestly she was pretty rude to the next people in line too."

I think their sushi is the best in South Brooklyn, very spicy and loaded with rice.

I have visited hundreds of Japanese or Asian resturants throughout my 17 years living in US or Brooklyn. As a food enthusiast i always value the restaurant's price and overall quality to find the definition of a great and low-key family style restaurant. This is the kind of asian restaurant you will be guaranteed to return for more. This is the restaurant will leaves a mark in your hard-working souls. Because this is the closest place where you can find authenic mom & pops foods (to a large extend) for the love of awesome Japanese foods! I had an easy 10/10, the best wholesome Japanese/Asian food experience ever have waited for a long period of time. And to the owner(s) of this restaurant, thank you to figure out such a textbook-like low-key cozy Japanese resturant and such a fun customer-oriented business model (will be a huge success follow this principle), the 1st ever seen in NY in my opinion."

All very tasty and for a great price too. My personal standouts were the karaage salad and soup. The chicken karaage was juicy and flavorful. Perfectly seasoned. And not to mention all the ingredients in my salad tasted so fresh! The soup of the day was mushroom soup. There were pieces of bacon in it which added a nice smokey flavor. The interiors are cozy and momos is the perfect place to stop by for a quick bite. Or if you want to take your meal out to the pier and eat by the water…what a romantic day! We made our way out to the water after and it was the perfect day filled with delicious comforting foods :)"

However once you taste the food your mind is absolutely blown.  Once you get your food the smell alone is making your mouth water.  Then comes the actual taste and there is not enough words to describe it.  By far one of the best tasting meals I have had.  Connot wait to go back to try their other dishes."

Food is well made and fresh.\n\nThe chicken curry katsu was moist and comforting, and I loved the hint of sesame in the tuna sushi. The cream puff was structurally perfect and tasted delightful; it’s dense and super light and airy.\n\nThere are some seating to eat inside. I really like that they separated the curry from the rice/katsu for take out—preserving freshness and preventing sogginess."
