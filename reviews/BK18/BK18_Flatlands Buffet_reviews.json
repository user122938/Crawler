            "text": "My Family and I( total of 5 adults, 6 children) went to Flatlands Buffet after my nieces and son graduation. On arrival the restaurant is extremely underwhelming. My family arrived before I did and  being that my family had already paid I gave it a chance. When we sat to the table no one came to take our drink orders and we never received utensils. The food was tasteless and the surrounding environment was disgusting, very poor selection of food, the bathroom was filthy. It smelled when I arrived the entire experience just made my stomach hurt. My family and I had one plate each and rushed out of there. We tried the restaurant because it was close to home, the reviews weren’t bad and it had 4.0 stars. The place feels like a funeral dead silence and everyone just looking at each other and our eyes are saying why did we pay for this.  Do not waste your time going here for the price you can go to Flaming Grill & Buffet on Flatbush Ave and Tilden Ave next to Old navy and have a way better experience with great food with your family. If I could give negative stars I definitely would."
