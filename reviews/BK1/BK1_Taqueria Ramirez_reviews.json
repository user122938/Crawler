The line was pretty long, and I saw some people ordering to-go and eating outside, so I was worried I might have to do the same. Luckily, a spot opened up inside, and I got to sit down.\n\nWe started by ordering six tacos — one of each kind — and shared them between the two of us. Every single one was amazing! They were so good that we ended up ordering two more. I also loved the self-serve topping bar — it was fun to add what I liked. Overall, everything was delicious, and the experience was totally worth the wait. Highly recommend!"

Unfortunately, they were out of suadero and tripa, which I was really looking forward to, but that just gives me a reason to come back earlier next time.\n\nThe spot is small with limited seating, yet it was still buzzing with energy late into the night. The upbeat music added to the lively atmosphere, making it a great place to grab a bite.\n\nI ordered the pastor, which was hands down my favorite--packed with flavor and topped with a perfectly thin slice of pineapple for that extra touch of sweetness. The longaniza (spiced ground pork sausage) was decent, but not really my thing. The campechano, a mix of suadero and longaniza, was juicier thanks to the beef, making it a solid choice.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, and I loved the small DIY toppings station where you can load up on onions, cilantro, and sauces. The spicy sauce was incredible--just the right amount of heat!\n\nI'll definitely be back to try the other tacos. Can't wait!"

As a Californian living in NYC for the past 15 years, Mexican food in the city has been more miss than hit. These tacos remind me of home. The pastor had the right balance of sweet and savory, and the Suadero was just decadent and melt-in-your-mouth. You definitely need to account for a wait (we were about 12 people deep and the wait was about 20 minutes to get to the counter), so make sure you order ALL the tacos you want at once."

A line started forming around 11:45, but it moved quickly—maybe a 15–20 minute wait, max.\n\nDine-in only, but everything’s served on plastic plates for fast turnover. True to the CDMX street taco format: you get the meat on a tortilla, then head to the topping station for sauce, cilantro, and onions. Simple, efficient, and very DIY.\n\nAmong the three I tried, Tripa was my favorite. Slow-braised and then torched for a smoky finish. No seasoning (maybe the broth they boil it in has a little bit of spice), so I skipped toppings to savor its natural flavors. Still very soft, but it wasn’t too greasy.\n\nAl pastor was also solid. A bit salty on its own, but once I added diced onions and hot sauce, everything balanced out nicely. Classic combo.\n\nCampechano was a mix of Suadero and Longaniza. Good, but not my top pick. A little heavy for my taste, though I get why it’s a crowd pleaser."

Ci sono arrivata incuriosita dalle foto degli avventori e dalla faccia invitante dello spiedo, e devo dire che le aspettative non sono state solo confermate, ma superate.\n\nIl locale è piccolo e gestito interamente da una coppia di messicani che hanno saputo portare un pezzo vero di Messico a New York. La carne è semplicemente meravigliosa: ho provato sia i tacos di trippa sia il loro famoso al pastor e gli altri 2/3 presenti in menù tra cui quello al cactus, tutti eccezionali. Carne croccante fuori e morbida dentro tagliata al coltello.\nIl taco “al pastor” viene cotto sul trompo tradizionale, mentre altri tagli (suadero, tripa, longaniza) vengono cotti nella choricera, una pentola simile a un “jacuzzi di carne” creata su misura in Città del Messico.\n\nRispetto alla famosa catena con più sedi a NYC, qui la qualità è nettamente superiore: pochi tacos, preparati con cura e passione. C’è anche un piccolo davanzale dove si possono finire di condire a piacimento con peperoncino, coriandolo, guacamole o cipolla cruda: un dettaglio che rende l’esperienza ancora più autentica.\n\nIn poche parole: super consigliato. Se siete in visita a New York o Brooklyn, non lasciatevelo scappare!"

Got in quite quickly (less than 10 minute wait).. very simple clean interiors.. we were able to place our order quickly.. we wanted to have one of each taco but they were out of the tripe - so we had the other 5.. Compechano was hands down our favorite - perfect seasoning and the meat was cooked to perfection! The other flawless taco was the Suadero - slow cooked beef confit was juicy and tender and the taco was just overflowing with the meat and juice! Least favorite was the Nopales - didn't like the texture of the cactus nor the seasoning. The Nopales taco at Los Tacos No 1 is WAYYYY better.. the other 2 tacos were good but one was underseasoned and the other was overseasoned..all in all, service is efficient, it's a simple/chill ambiance and the meat portions are massive..but they lacked some seasoning consistency and definitely need to think about that nopales taco! I'm very glad i did this but will probably not go out of way again for this taqueria."

            "text": "This place was WILD busy on a Sunday mid-afternoon although the line and service moves pretty fast. All the meats we tried were good, and the price was pretty standard. They also let you put the taco toppings on yourself, which was awesome. Their homemade salsas are really really good. Seating is pretty cramped and it doesn't seem that take out is an option, so off-peak hours might be better if you want to make sure you don't feel rushed."

The torched longazia sausage is great too, but I can never get enough of the pastor so I've only tried those two.\n\nEveryone who works here is great too. They're always so kind and hard working. It feels like they really take pride in everything they do and it shows.\n\nI lived nearby for 2 years and went here countless times. Moved out of the neighborhood recently and I miss it so much I still stop in when I can."

            "text": "Taqueria Ramirez is that neighborhood taco shop that’s worth the hype. I especially love how deftly seasoned the fillings are and their bright and stingy salsa. Watching the chefs preparing tripa and suadero in bubbling lard inside a como choricero is yet another down-to-earth experience. Not to mention their kicky salsa roja with habanero and creamy tomatillo-avocado salsa verde, which is unapologetically delicious.\n\nStill, paying 5 bucks for a single taco (where, for the same price, you can get half a dozen in CDMX) but I guess that’s a reasonable economic behavior now since we’re talking the most gentrified part of Greenpoint. Regardless, I’m willing to pay for good quality food. Cállate and take my money, Ramirez."

I love how you can dress the tacos yourself (as someone who hates onion on top), and their spicy sauce actually has some heat.\n\nAbsolutely worth the wait in line (only took a few minutes) and will look forward to coming back."
