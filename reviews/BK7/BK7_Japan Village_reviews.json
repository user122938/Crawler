But the things you get ARE worth your while.\n\nSo give the place a chance and visit. Im looking for an excuse to go back or just to go and wonder some more.

            "text": "In the heart of New York City, lies Japan Village. This two floor cultural oasis is dedicated to immersing visitors in the rich heritage and vibrant spirit of Japan. Whether it is mochi pounding or tea ceremonies or authentic Japanese food, there are tons of things to eat and do in Japan Village to experience Japan, without having to travel there.\n\nThe first floor is mainly for food and drinks. There are 10 food stalls, 5 restaurants & bars, a grocery store, a liquor store, and a bakery & café. The food stalls offer various foods, from bento boxes to finger foods to onigiri to ramen. Seats are limited, so get here early or have a friend save a table for the group! Of course, you have to check out the Sunrise Mart. This is a Japanese supermarket that offers authentic ingredients, fresh produce, sushi-grade fish, ready-made meals, condiments, and cosmetics.\n\nThe second floor consists of 6 shops: Book Off, Daiso, Bandai Namco, Taro's Origami, Japanklyn, and Kiddleton. For anime and manga lovers, you have to check out Book Off, Kiddleton, and Bandai Namco for some amazing collectibles! For those that want to explore more of Japanese culture, check out Daiso, which is a Japanese dollar store, or Japanklyn, a lifestyle store that blends Japanese streetwear and culture with a Brooklyn's touch.\n\nYou will need more than one day to check everything here! Especially, since Japan Village is just a small part of Industry City. I highly recommend you plan your day in advance, especially since some stores are difficult to find. You should also check out their social media pages and their website to learn about their events! They offer tea ceremonies, interactive Japanese horror experiences, magical girls festival, idol events, and much more!"

            "text": "This place was amazing. It perfectly fits the vibe of Japanese culture and makes it better.\n\nHere are some places I would recommend to go to.\n\nBANDAI NAMACO (2nd Floor) ~\n\nUsually placed in Japan, this store opened just a few months ago in Sunset Park. It has tons of machines that distribute prizes and toys, and $2 for a coin. The machines usually take an average of 3 or 2 coins for each one, so make sure you have your credit card or cash out and ready to purchase. Additionally, it has multiple Japanese arcade machines! From driving to drum games, the mini arcade has a wide variety of different options. Along with this, there is a special card you can get exclusively for this. It works for arcade games in Japan, too. It’s the Bandai Passport! Use this for most of the games, and it’ll unlock a data saving feature. From you customizing cars and buying things with digital currency in the racing sims, or customizing your cute little bean guy in a drum rhythm game with drumsticks. This passport unlocks many features to explore. Finally, the store itself (of course) has different categories to choose and buy from. From the popular shows like One Piece or Gundam, it’s amazing how much they have here.\n\n9.4/10. Very Fun here! Wide variety of items and games, and helpful staff, but very expensive for the tokens which unlock most stuff in the store.\n\nSUNRISE MART (1st Floor) ~\n\nThis store is great! It has a very wide range of products and services that are very affordable and easy to get. The place is very well maintained and has great products to choose from— like Ramen, Mochi, Pork Belly, Candy, Sweets, and much.. much more that I can’t even name. And quite literally, everything here is from Japan! Very busy, but it’s not the store’s fault that it’s just too good!\n\n10/10. Great Products, Affordable Prices, and Outstanding Quality.\n\nSUSHI KO (1st Floor) ~\n\nPlaced in a little area that’s just a U turn away from the doors from the courtyard, comes a place that’s just too tasty to be true. If you love sushi, you shouldn’t want to come here— you must come here. It has a small selection of food, but don’t let that stop you. There’s much more to await you on this tasty raw journey. Firstly, I would love to recommend you the item “Omakase A.” Meaning “I’ll Leave It To You” in Japanese, makes the chef lead you on this first journey through sushi town. For $35, you get 7 pieces of absolute perfection. Ranging from salmon to chopped liver seasoned with soy sauce and things I can’t even name, it makes me drool. So much things await you here.\nWhen should you go?\nDinner and Lunch.\nDINNER - 10/10 Amazing, and it includes desert. (Green Cake In Photo Listed Below)\nLUNCH - 9.5/10 Outstanding sushi, and delicious drinks.\n\n10/10. Quite Literally, Best sushi I’ve ever had in my entire life!!\n\n(FOR SUSHI KO ONLY, PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ARE LISTED BELOW. PHOTOGRAPHY OF ANY KIND IS NOT ALLOWED IN BANDAI NAMCO.)"

My bar for matcha/hojicha desserts is very high, but they won my heart with the authenticity and richness of tea flavors.\n\n＊Monaka Mont Blanc (NEW!!) $8\nSeasonal item. Chestnut dessert is the perfect wintery sweet treat imo. Sandwiched between two crispy wafers, monaka is beuatifully layered with azuki bean paste, whipped cream, and sweetened chestnut purée. It was so amazing to witness how they pipe the fresh chestnut purée into distinctive threads. I love japanese style mont blanc because it is lighter and not too sweet.\n\n＊Hojicha Mochi Ice Cream $8\n＊Mango Mochi Ice Cream $8\nFirst, the size of their ice cream scoop is unbelievably huge. They precisely weight every scoop and gently wrap it with mochi dough. The mochi part is very chewy and stretchy (look at the mochi pull!!). The most delightful part is that they add tea jelly and red bean paste on the bottom.\n\nI’ve tried matcha, hojicha and mango so far, and hojicha ice cream is my absolute favorite."

There is limited seating in this fresh food interior area. Shops on the 2nd floor including cosmetics, pottery and an anime shop.\n\nThere is a center courtyard area with some seating and a small stage. At the time, there was someone performing (singing).\n\nParking available in surrounding lots...particularly, Lot C is reasonably only being $5 on weekends. $15-20 during the week though. Can pre-book and pay for parking via the Laz Parking app."
