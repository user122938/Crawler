            "text": "I was able to enjoy a tasting menu at Khaosan, and had such a lovely experience!\n\nThe decor and even the exterior of the restaurant is covered in florals and hunter green - super welcoming and aesthetic at the same time.\n\nThe drink menu is extensive, and includes soft drinks, specialty drinks as well as cocktails and mock tails ranging from $10-18. I got the classic Thai iced tea - very tea forward and still quite sweet despite requesting less sweet FYI! My friend enjoyed the honey yuzu lemonade a lot.\n\nMy favorites were the spaghetti soft shell crab. The pasta was al dente and well spiced. I’d definitely get this again and beware of the pepper pieces within the pasta! They can be quite spicy. The soft shell crab was crispy and I really enjoyed this!\n\nThe grilled black pepper pork with truffle oil was so good - the pork was super tender and having the rice with the sauce was super yummmy. The sauce is very coconut forward.\n\nThe staff is amazing here and very attentive. I’ll definitely be back to try the lunch special that they have!"

            "text": "Last year, while browsing food photos online, I was instantly captivated by a Thai restaurant framed in a bloom of flowers – that was Khaosan Thai. 🌸 I finally had the chance to visit, and I must say: it exceeded all expectations. From the ambience to the artistry of the dishes and, most importantly, the flavors, everything was executed to perfection. Few restaurants manage to score high in every detail – this one absolutely does.\n\n🍸 Cocktails First\n\n⭐Pear No.1 – refreshing, fruit-forward, and layered with subtle flavors.\n\n⭐White Lychee Sangria – among all the lychee cocktails I’ve tried, this one truly stands out with its complex, balanced notes.\n\n🦀 A Crab Feast\nI went all in on crab dishes – three different styles, each impressive in its own way:\n\n⭐Crab Cakes – deceptively modest in appearance, but generously packed with delicate shreds of crab meat.\n\n⭐Crab Meat Fried Rice – a Thai staple, but here the eggs are extraordinary: silky like a custard yet fragrant like a perfect stir-fry.\n\n⭐Spaghetti Soft Shell Crab – my absolute favorite of the night. Arriving with an irresistible aroma, it was bold, flavorful, and kissed with true wok hei.\n\n🍛 More Highlights\n\n⭐Thai Green Curry Roti (N) – rich, aromatic curry paired beautifully with warm, flaky roti.\n\n⭐Seared Sea Bass in Sweet & Sour Sauce – theatrically flambéed at the table, tender fish complemented by a vibrant fruit-and-vegetable sauce.\n\n⭐Mango Ice Cream with Sticky Rice – a playful hot-and-cold experience: the cool creaminess of ice cream against the comforting warmth of sticky rice.\n\n✨ By the time we left, the restaurant was buzzing, even on a weekday evening – a true sign of its popularity. If you’re looking for a spot that is consistently impressive and never misses the mark, Khaosan Thai should be at the top of your list."

The food came out quick and freshly hot and it was SOO good! I feel like Thai food is easy to over eat but they give you the perfect portion sizes. The ice cream over sticky mango rice was a great desert"

They package it well, wrapping up the curry so it doesn't spill and staple the paper bag. The latter is why I didn't check for the appetizer. Sucks that I am 1/2 of getting an appetizer, first time I got it but this time I didn't."

For appetizers, we ordered the crab cakes and calamari. While the calamari was perfectly crispy and flavorful, the crab cakes were just okay—not quite what we expected.\n\nFor our mains, we had the salmon and shrimp panang curry, shrimp pineapple fried rice, and sticky rice. Everything was beautifully presented, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection. We’d gladly reorder it all next time!\n\nThe atmosphere was inviting, the food presentation was thoughtful, and the service was attentive and friendly. Khaosan has definitely earned a spot on our list of favorites, and we look forward to coming back soon!"
