This wasn’t just food poisoning it was terrifying.\n\nI wouldn’t wish this on anyone. Based on my experience and the other bad reviews, it’s clear they have serious issues with food safety and hygiene. If you care about your health, stay far away from this place.‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️⚠️"

Their pan-fried dumplings are a standout, perfectly crisp on the outside while delivering a juicy, flavorful filling. Each bite is a satisfying blend of textures that leaves you craving more.\n\nThe hand-pulled noodle soup is equally impressive, featuring tender noodles swimming in a rich, savory broth that warms the soul. The freshness of the noodles, combined with fresh vegetables and a hint of spice, makes it a comforting choice, especially on a chilly day.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and welcoming, ideal for a quick meal or a relaxed dining experience. With generous portions and reasonable prices, Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House is a must-visit for anyone craving delicious dumplings and noodles in Elmhurst. Highly recommended!"

When you see the bright red awning, you know you’re at the right spot. The pork and leek boiled dumplings here are very hearty, meaty, and super juicy. They’re thicker-skinned dumplings which are definitely going to leave you full. Came here last week with my husband for a fast, casual experience with cafeteria-style seating and good dumplings. A box will fill you up quick in this no-frills restaurant. Don’t forget to load up on the chili oil, soy sauce, and hot sauce!\n\n2024 pricing-\n🥟 $3 for (4) pork & leek fried dumplings\n🥟 $6 for (8) pork & leek boiled dumplings\n\n4/29/2021: (Update #1)\nStill cash only & we noticed that the prices for the dumplings haven't increased for a couple of years now! My fiance and I ordered the #1 Pork & Leek Fried Dumpling (8 pieces, $4.25), #2 Pork & Leek Boiled Dumplings (8 pieces, $4.25), and #44 Scallion Pancakes w/ Beef ($4.50). Had a pretty mediocre meal at Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House last night though. The fried dumplings were much too charred and dry, compared to the previous times we've had meals here. The scallion pancake was not appetizing at all, being too thick and flavorless. The limp lettuce and the 2 thin beef circles didn't go well together either. At least the Pork & Leek Boiled Dumplings were still good - next time we'll just stick with multiples of that dish!\n\n6/10/2019: (Original Review)\nLao Bei Fang Dumpling House is always a good comfort food stop, if you're in the mood for some delicious greasy foods. My boyfriend and I came here after a day of rock climbing and it really hit the spot. We ordered the #1 Pork & Leek Fried Dumpling (8 pieces, $4.25), #2 Pork & Leek Boiled Dumplings (8 pieces, $4.25), and #28 All-in-one House Special Hand-Pulled Noodle Soup ($8.75). Filling, good portions, and reasonably priced. Street parking could be a bit tricky, but is available (metered and free). Cash only, and they call your number when your order is ready!"

Both exterior and interior is nothing to brag about, simply look like many other take out joint with some tables scattered but the amount of foot traffic is insane and many for their famous Pork & Leek Potstickers. They do serve noodles and such but the main event are the Potstickers\n\nThese potstickers are made in huge batches and since so many people buy (sold in increments of 4), they are always fresh, hot, juicy with perfect golden crispy crust. Don’t forget the hot oil and dumpling sauce.\n\nThis is definitely a must try if you’re in Elmhurst area. Street parking after 7pm is easier and free. There’s no tipping and it’s self service. Cheapest and best bang for your buck in the area."

If you are a dumpling fan, their dumplings are different than gyoza that other places have; it has a much thicker skin and definitely feels heartier. The noodles are hand-pulled and have the perfect texture, and they do not skimp on the toppings. There is chili oil on every table that you can feel free to add on, I think it adds a very nice flavor to it. They also sell packs of 50 frozen dumplings, I try to make sure I always have them in stock when I come. The only thing is that the boiled dumplings do take a bit of time to come out, which is probably because they cooked to order; not a complaint but just an FYI in case you are limited on time."

For as low as $6.50, one gets a big bowl of freshly hand-pulled noodle, stir fried or in broth.  And they really do give ample amount of noodle!  The menu selections are fun and enticing.  The value proposition is definitely there,  and I can see why the locals keep coming back and where the rave reviews come from.\n\nBut that's all the good things I can say about this place.  The divey setup at the ordering counter, and the self-help communal tables remind me of the street hawker setup at night markets in Asia -- not so hygienic.  One would be tempted to sit down because of the lure of the food, but at the same time wary of the risk of getting sick as a result of downplaying the possible lack of hygiene.  Well, I had been lucky before but finally met my fate today.  I had the Lamb Mixed Hand Drawn Noodle Soup and a couple of pot stickers for lunch.  One of the two dishes caused my stomach cramps so bad that I had to make 2 emergency stops during my 3 hour drive back to PA.\n\nEat at your own risk!  For me, getting sick once is more than enough."

The place is pretty big so is easy to find a table over here.\n\nI will say if you're in the quest for a Fried Dumplings or a  Boiled Dumplings, maybe Steam Dumplings or maybe another type of dumplings you find your spot.  structure of the dumplings and the taste are phenomenal and the price for it makes it even better. The staff are ok only bad things about this place is a cash only place. You also can find all time or ramen and noodle soup over here, although the place is called dumplings house you can also all kinds of Asian dishes.\n\nParking for those that does have car is a bit hard."
