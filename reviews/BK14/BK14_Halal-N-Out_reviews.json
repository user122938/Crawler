If you need to get a filling meal, or one to share I recommend the lamb over rice, they also have chicken, shrimp,steak,falafel,fish,chicken kofta kebab over rice. My favorite here is the cheese burger and fries, it’s so juicy and fresh. But if you want a lighter burger get the smash burger. the lemonade is fresh and homemade. There’s indoor and outside seating."

Not only is the food always made fresh and delicious, but the customer service is a solid 10/10 every single time.\n\nToday was rainy and gloomy, but I decided to step out and grab dinner from one of my favorite spots. I come here often, and there’s one particular guy (I wish I’d gotten his name!) who’s always so kind and helpful.\n\nAnyway, he took my order as usual and I headed home. While crossing the street to my building, the paper bag they gave me completely burst (I even took a picture 🫠). In a panic, I called the restaurant; they immediately remembered me and without hesitation offered to replace my entire meal at no charge.\n\nI was so upset and frustrated, but their kindness completely turned my mood around. Now I’m sitting at home, full and happy, writing this review because it’s rare to find a business that genuinely cares about their customers instead of just the money.\n\nThank you, Halal Bros, for turning what could’ve been a terrible evening into such a positive one. You’ve definitely earned a loyal customer for life!\n– Heidi :)"

            "text": "This place recently opened up in an area that is very heavily focused on Caribbean food, so it was lacking in some middle eastern cuisine/ American halal food. This restaurant definitely fills up that spot. Their menu is expansive, they also have cold cut sandwiches which is extremely rare from a halal restaurant, at least the ones I’ve been to some have turkey sandwiches lol.\n\nThey also have your typical platters chicken/ lamb/ fish etc. Never had it, but it looks good. Pretty good prices all around, but does get a bit pricey if you want to get a couple different things. Came from the gym and I was looking for a protein rich post workout meal so I decided on a gyro. Full transparency, I haven’t had many gyros but this was one of the best gyros I’ve had. $9. Ate it two different times. Definitely worth the money. The guy who made my gyro was friendly and definitely accommodating to my questions, and gave recommendations, he hooked my gyro up. I appreciated the love!\n\nIf you’re in the area or if you’re a local, it’s definitely worth the visit even if it’s to check out their menu. Kitchen was open and clean, work station was also tidy.\n\nOverall, a great addition to the neighborhood! Give them a try, they’ll get you right. 🔥"
