I’ll definitely be back when I’m in New York again. Thank you!😊"

You go in, order at the counter, and they bring the food out to you. No waiting staff. Its a 3-person staff from what I can see so things take time.\n\nIt can get frustrating at busy hours as the woman up front takes care of the orders, cashier, and brings out food. This is more of a take out than a sit down dinner. Place is brightly lit and when it gets busy, the line to order can get long, then you have to hope a table opens up. Best to order take-out."

The food is all freshly made with love and care, you can surely taste the dedication. The casual milk-bar style dining popularized during Soviet era Poland is nostalgically revived accompanied by traditional Polish art and decorative motifs on the walls and fixtures. The selection of regional foods is exciting with considerable vegan and gluten free options. The staff and owners are super friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this place. It’s great for takeout and sit down though your food will taste better if you eat it fresh and enjoy the Polish atmosphere."

During a recent NYC trip, our Polish friends took us to the Polish neighborhood in Brooklyn and we were very lucky to have stopped by Restaurant Relax.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the restaurant felt warm and welcoming. We have never visited Poland, but it was like stepping into a restaurant in the country itself. The charming decorations and cozy atmosphere set the perfect vibe for a wonderful meal in a cold winter day. There were so many tempting options on the menu, so we asked our friends for any recommendations and ended up ordering a little bit of everything. Though we over-ordered, we couldn't have been happier with our experience.\n\nEvery dish was absolutely delicious, from the borscht and crispy kielbasa to the stuffed cabbage and cauliflower soup. We even paired our meal with a refreshing Polish beer. Not to mention, the staff was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and provided us with a wonderful dining experience.\n\nThe only downside is that we live 2.5 hours away, so we can’t visit as often as we’d like. If you're ever in Brooklyn, Restaurant Relax is a must-visit. Amazing food, amazing people, and amazing service. Restaurant Relax, Dziękuję bardzo!"

Came with a side of red cabbage salad which was great.\n- flounder filet with French fries, beets and carrot salads (4.5/5): while it was a fried fish, it still tasted fresh somehow. Solid portion! Salads were solid - particularly the carrots.\n- crepes with cheese and apple (4/5): very nice and again, great portion size. Our mistake was ordering the crepes with the rest of the food since it all came out at the same time, and it was more cooled down by the time we ate it. Suggest either ordering it later or letting them know to bring it out later.\n\nVibe: it feels like you’re in a cozy polish mountain ski hut. This place has been around since 97 but they def updated the restaurant since then. It had a very family-owned restaurant feel. Would love to come back and try some of their soups.\n\nIf you’re looking for a no-frills, cozy, good price-to-portion ratio spot, this is your spot. Music was also great."

Haven’t eaten polish food for some time we went with classic- pork cutlet and potato pancakes with goulash.\nCutlet was good, potatoes and salads ok but potatoes were covered with a goulash gravy sauce that was bad.\nUnlike the first, potato pancakes were disappointing.  Pancakes were either made from powder or there was too much flour added you didn’t feel potatoes, they were tasteless, not seasoned well with salt and paper so just like fried flour. Goulash meat was not bad, it was cooked well, but grave sauce - same that we got on potatoes- was bad. It might have been powdered gravy, but didn’t taste like nothing than water with flour thickening. This food is not worth more than $5 or not worth going at all.\nIt is self service place, folks&knives and thin napkins you need to get yourself. Line to order food like old times communism line. Long wait. This place is not like Poland looks like, maybe 30 years ago so don’t get it wrong.\nService very nice and the cashier woman taking orders super nice but that is not enough to return. Sorry. Not recommended to anyone that wants to try polish food, this place is not like polish mama food."
