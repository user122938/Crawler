This place rips the subtotal of a receipt and writes a general money value like 30USD on your uber eate receipt . Moreover , the prices are higher than in store, about 20% overall and I feel like you also get 10% less food, especially the more costly items like meat but a lot of rice added .  The meat tastes weird , like they put MSG powder all over and it does not taste fresh , it tastes almost like its preserved with some \"chemicals\".  To make matters worse , you usually get a lot or bone and unwanted non meat parts added to your meal like cartilage . Overall this place is probably okay in-person and just a sad thing for delivery on their third party platforms . I have never seen a receipt ripped with a \" general USD price written on the paper like 34.20 total in reality says 30 USD .\" Its almost like they give you as much food as much money you pay instead of it being a dish . I guess this is just Asian behavior ."

The Three Choices BBQ Rice (I picked roast duck, crispy pork, and soy chicken) came with generous portions, perfect seasoning, and fresh veggies. Even the milk tea was great — not overly sweet, just right. Delivery was quick, and everything was still hot and beautifully packed. Will 100% order again!"

This place is always bustling with energy—a clear sign of how beloved it is by locals and visitors alike—but despite the crowd, the service never falters. The servers are incredibly attentive, friendly, and manage the busy floor with ease.\n\nWhat really sets King’s Kitchen apart, though, is the food. Every dish arrives fresh, piping hot, and packed with flavor. The menu is extensive, but I can’t recommend their clay pot dishes enough—they are truly something special. My personal favorites? The braised brisket with tofu skin, which is melt-in-your-mouth tender and deeply savory, and the salted fish and chicken with eggplant, a beautifully balanced dish that’s both bold and comforting.\n\nWhether you’re a regular or a first-time diner, King’s Kitchen never disappoints."
