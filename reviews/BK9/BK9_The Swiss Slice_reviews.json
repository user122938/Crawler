Their open concept with the two doors adds a lot of appeal to the place. You can easily walk in, inspect the various pizzas and chose what you want. The margharita slice is my go to, very cheesy, sweet tomato sauce, not too soggy. I have also been tempted to try their new flavors, more recently the sausage pepperoni ,red onions and peppers combo. Very tasty. They have added late hours which is great since a lot of other places are dead past 10pm. Above all, the service is amazing. The staff and owner are always cheerful and insightful on the menu. Definitely a  favorite local spot!"

They are adding new flavors like burrata or new type of pepperoni or something because the quality change is noticeable. The guys there seem to really be proud of their pies :) I like coming here more and more.\n\nUpdate- oops! I gave them 4 :) they are a 5"

            "text": "Let's dive into the realm of mouthwatering pizza slices and the vibrant borough of Brooklyn. As a devoted enthusiast, one of my top recommendations is Swiss slices, a culinary gem nestled in the bustling streets of New York City.\n\nDuring my recent escapade to Brooklyn, I indulged in a slice of their heavenly margarita pepperoni pizza. The cheese melted delicately in my mouth, while the flavors harmonized in a symphony of satisfaction. Additionally, I couldn't resist the temptation of their saucy buffalo chicken slice, which left my taste buds in awe.\n\nWhat sets Swiss slices apart is their diverse range of options. Whether you're a vegan seeking culinary bliss or a meat lover in pursuit of the perfect slice, they have something for everyone. But their expertise goes beyond pizza alone. Prepare to be captivated by their tantalizing pasta dishes, delectable Italian sausage, and an array of bread options that will transport you straight to Italy.\n\nBefore you embark on your own culinary adventure, be sure to look up Swiss slices and let them know that Marie sent you. Trust me, you won't regret it."

It’s perplexing how these pizzas got such positive reviews since they were very mediocre and overpriced for their quality. I figured since this was a local establishment away from touristic spots, the prices would be more modest, but honestly paying over seven dollars for 2 very subpar slices in Flatbush just didn’t sit right with me. I’m okay with paying more for good quality, but these pizzas don’t have the quality & flavor to back up their price.\nThe staff was pretty friendly though, so that’s nice.\n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.\nThere are better quality pizzas nearby for less cost."
