Watching the worker make the breads from scratch as you come in is a nice touch.\n\nStaff was very friendly and courteous and took the time to explain all the different dishes.\n\nThe freshly-made laffa was a really nice treat - especially in an era when restaurants cut back on the \"fresh bread basket\" starter that was common only a short while ago.\n\nFor starters we ordered the Appetizer Combo which included Falafel, Moroccan cigars, Chicken (egg)roll & Kibbeh. All were 10/10, although the falafel could have used a bit more of the cilantro and other seasoning you would expect in a falafel .\n\nAlthough this is a Middle-Eastern joint, and we should have gone for their specialty dishes (shawarma, kebobs, etc.) we went with burgers, schnitzel, and all the sides. The burgers hit the spot, although we would have wanted thicker patties. And the schnitzel was the best we have ever had: thin, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside; fried to perfection. 10/10!\n\nWe will definitely be going back to try the Middle-Eastern dishes."

He offered excellent recommendations and made sure our glasses were never empty. His positive energy and genuine care for our experience took our evening from great to unforgettable.

Their lafa is warm, soft, and perfect for wrapping around their juicy baby chicken, which is always seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. The variety of fresh salads they serve alongside the meal adds a refreshing balance, and everything comes together beautifully on the plate.\n\nTheir French fries are also a standout—crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and served in generous portions. Whether you’re dining in or taking out, Olympia delivers a delicious and well-rounded experience every time. It’s one of those places you find yourself wanting to go back to again and again."
