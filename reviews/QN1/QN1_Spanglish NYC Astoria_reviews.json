Their brunch burger has chicharrón which adds a nice crunchy kick to already an amazing burger and their Mexican burger is just as delicious with a Spanish twist to a classic. If you love pizza or birria tacos or both, I highly recommend their birria pizza which combines both and gives it a unique flavor. If you’re into seafood, their ceviche is also a must try as well and as always, don’t forget to grab yourself a nice refreshing margarita, passion fruit or my fave, the coconut passion fruit margarita is Delicious 👌🏼"

It was just average.\nNothing special.\n\nThe pizza, barely had any meat on it, and the server also had forgotten to bring the birria sauce that “supposedly” comes with it.\nI had to ask them for it.\nFunny thing is that, they seem surprised that I was asking for it. Oh well.\nThe chicken tacos were bland, no much flavor.\nBelow average I’d say.\n\nAnother thing is The overpriced Guacamole.\nYou get four chips and half an avocado.\nNot worth it.\n\nDon’t let “Flashy and well produced videos and photos” fool you.\nYou are not going to get what you see online. Not even close.\n\nThis is just my experience.\nHopefully, it’s better when you go!! lol"
