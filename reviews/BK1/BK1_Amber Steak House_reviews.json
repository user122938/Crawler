            "text": "We went Saturday 10/18 - 8 pm reservation for our 4th wedding anniversary and we can’t wait for the next reason to come back .\nNo crowd at all it was wonderful ,the atmosphere was quaint and quiet . Just enough to hear the person at your table\n\nAndrzej was our server , he was attentive enough to know when we needed him and when we didn’t and that was something we love at establishments, so this was a plus . Especially since it was our anniversary and the table talk was that important.\n\nWe started with the following drinks . And let me tell you the bartender did not disappoint.\nI had a French martini and I never had one and it was delicious , not too sweet and I’m not a raspberry girl but it was amazing . The hint of vanilla was amazing , I’d definitely order it again .\nMy husband had a Raspberry peach margarita , I would’ve liked it without raspberry but also delicious.\n\nSecond round\nPeach cosmo , wasn’t a fan too sweet just my taste but it was a good drink .\nLynchburg’s lemonade was almost like a Jack Daniel’s Lemonade and it got the spot , so refreshing and not skimped on the alcohol either.\nDrinks service 10/10\n\nNext was appetizers\nCaesar salad , now I read the reviews and still gave it a try and they were right . It has a hint of Russian dressing to it , was not a fan & probably wouldn’t order it again . Didn’t give the traditional taste to me .\nCalamari , yea give me 10 of them ,add some banana peppers and we got a deal . They were airy and light and the batter was delicious.\nGrilled bacon -  This was a game changer for me , I’m going to need to order two next time . Yes that good , Smokey flavor and that sauce that came with it paired so well .\n\nEntree\n\nPorterhouse for two grilled to a perfection of medium rare , it was amazing.\nWe made sure to take the bone home to our dog\nThe char was perfection , it was fork tender even the day after\nWe paired them with the lobster mac and cheese which was so tender juicy and decadent. And the roasted potatoes with onion and peppers , it gave off home fries vibes and I was not a fan . I expected roasted potatoes in half maybe with the skin still on.\n\nWe ended the night with crème brûlée which had a faint hint of lemon that I was not a fan of and tossed the traditional taste out the window and the espresso ice cream which was decadent and delicious .\n\nThe service was 10/10\nOverall meal withe nuances 9/10\n\nI’m definitely coming back !"

I came with a party of 8 everyone had some sort of gripe with this establishment.  My food was not good at all. I order the strip with shrimp and scampi sauce. Shrimp was really dry and I have never had a more tasteless scampi sauce. It tasted like water and steak drippings. The steak was flavorless as well. I don't like seasoned steak aside from salt and pepper..  The steak didn't do for me at all.Never been to a steakhouse where the steak was not the star. Never going back to Amber Steakhouse. Oh and that beet stuffed apple was horrible.  I had high hopes for it."

Excellent sauces for fried calamari, really bring out different tastes, well balanced salad, refreshing and crisp; nicely done porterhouse (move over Peter Lugar's) , crispy fries. A hearty grilled seafood and delightful variety. meticulous service: warm bread, soft butter, clean table between courses, don't stack plates in front of your nose- these should have been basic yet very rarely found these days. We had a great dinner and definitely want to come back again soon!"

Unfortunately, the experience didn’t live up to the hype. The service was lackluster, and both the porterhouse steak and mac and cheese were seriously underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and take your money to Benjamin Steakhouse instead—you’ll get much better service and food that actually delivers on quality."

Real perfection of cooking. waiters who know the answer to every culinary question. This is a place you have to visit and eat."

Ordered the burrata and gnocchi, Caesar salad, ny strip, baked potato, asparagus, crème brûlée, espresso ice cream, earl grey tea and a cappuccino. Everything was great but we were especially surprised by the burrata (baby tomato, pine nuts, pesto and apricot was a refreshing change from basic caprese) and the well-executed char on the steak which went well with the house made steak sauce. The service was great, personalized and kind. The atmosphere was relaxing yet luxurious. The interior of the restaurant is very pretty and feels classic. We asked for a window seat in our reservation and enjoyed the view. Great first time experience for our special night. I’d love to try their diverse seafood selection next time. Thanks again!"

The food was exquisite and the service was so welcoming, accommodating (we had two babies with us), and generous. Our EXCELLENT server told us he has to move back to Equador, and it broke our hearts, as he was a sincerely lovely human. We had the octupus, Boston salad, Caesar salad, the bacon (omg), Porterhouse for two, filet and shrimp, the 8oz filet, and various sides. Everything was BUSSIN. We can’t wait to return, and we will miss our server!"

Don’t get me wrong, the decor and interior was really nice and\nChic. The servers were really attentive and personable but the food is a whole other ballgame. The lemon drop cocktail was the star of this show. The calamari was bland and lukewarm. I ordered the creamed spinach which tasted bland and a bit freezer burnt . The spinach had the worst after taste. The lobster Mac and cheese was runny and grainy. You can tell a roux was the main point in making this mac and cheese but it was so underwhelming. The lobster Mac and cheese was extremely disappointing. My surf and turf was pretty good but a bit on the cold side. The waiter traded out the lobster Mac and cheese for mashed potato but when he brought it out they were ice cube cold (lowkey like vanilla icecream).\nThe only hot thing was my mates steak which they took back and replaced when they realized he was shaking the table trying to cut into the steak that was supposed to medium and not overly well done. He was shaking the table so hard all we could do was apologize to the patrons next to us and laugh embarrassingly lol. The manager was nice and understanding but nothing was taken off the bill for our less than stellar experience. Very disappointed in my first visit here. Doubt I’ll come back."

Unfortunately, we have to report it was an overall mediocre experience. Let’s start with the service, we felt it was quite rushed and abrupt. The way our waitress splashed the oil of our sizzling porterhouse steak all over the table was of course accidental, but the response to it not very professional.  Some of the oil came on my jacket which I found out about later.\nThen the food, it was honestly very average, whereby the steak was OK but we definitely had better. The creamed spinach (oh my!) was definitely not freshly made and tasted like it was from a package. The mashed potato were OK, a bit bland. The mushrooms however were quite good.\nThe drinks: I ordered a Margarita cocktail, which I wouldn’t recommend.\nThe cherry on the cake though was really the totally weird trance/techno-playlist from the early 2000´s (what’s going on there?), the price was around $280, so we had expected quite a better experience for this amount.  We left wondering what really went wrong here."

There isn’t really anything I could point out specifically as bad…it just missing something that would make it a wow 5 star meal.  There weren’t a ton of people in the place when we went and we got stat sorta in a skinny walkway where all the staff had to walk so we felt a bit cramped.  I think we could have been seated in many other seats to not be seated squished against a wall.  The drinks were nice and strong, I got the filet and my husband got a bone in ribeye.  We split French fries.  Both steaks were cooked to our liking but again…it wasn’t anything I couldn’t get from a steakhouse that isn’t 45 mins away from us.  But if you want reliably well cooked and tasty steaks, you can trust you’ll get that here!"

The overall experience was fun and energetic. The noise level was medium, but really picked up as the night went on because it became really crowded but overall a positive atmosphere and what can I say about the attentive staff the minute you walk in you’re greeted warmly and the server and service are professional and attentive while it is a little above average when it comes to the expensive of the meal, but for an occasional treat, it’s definitely worth the price very tasty well cooked to perfection food with all this is a worthy offbeat and path, Brooklyn steakhouse I would highly recommend it above even some of the old-school ones throughout New York City.

While the food, service, and ambiance were exceptional, the initial encounter with the hostess left much to be desired.\n\nUpon entering, I was greeted by a less-than-friendly hostess whose demeanor seemed to lack warmth and hospitality. Her lackadaisical attitude was an unexpected start to what turned out to be an otherwise delightful evening. It's worth noting that first impressions matter, and unfortunately, this one didn't set the best tone for the evening.\n\nHowever, as soon as we were seated, the atmosphere of Amber Steak House began to work its magic. The ambiance was sophisticated, with a blend of modern aesthetics and a cozy, inviting feel. The dim lighting and tasteful decor created an intimate setting, perfect for a dinner outing.\n\nThe menu featured an array of steak options, and our server was not only knowledgeable but also passionate about the offerings. Their recommendations were spot-on, and the food that followed was nothing short of excellent. Each dish was expertly prepared, showcasing the chef's skill and a commitment to quality ingredients. From the perfectly cooked steaks to the delectable sides, every bite was a testament to the culinary expertise in the kitchen.\n\nService throughout the meal was attentive without being intrusive. Our server demonstrated a keen understanding of pacing, ensuring that we felt well taken care of without feeling rushed. The staff's dedication to ensuring a positive dining experience was evident, and it significantly contributed to the overall enjoyment of the evening.\n\nIn spite of the rocky start with the hostess, the outstanding quality of the food, the impeccable service, and the inviting ambiance ultimately won me over. While the initial encounter could use improvement, the exceptional aspects of Amber Steak House managed to shine through, leaving me with a positive overall impression. I would recommend this establishment to fellow food enthusiasts, with the hope that the front-of-house staff can match the excellence demonstrated by their culinary counterparts."

Wife had the chicken and loved it, i have the porter house for 2 as reminded by my waiter. Who doesn't like little leftover steak for lunch?? Either way all around good experience."

The quality of the steak was superb  and it was prepared well.  The spinach complimented the steak will and the french onion soup was one of the better ones we have hadbin terms of flavorful broth and quality cheese. The staff were pleasant and the service was timely. My only word of caution if you will, is to make reservations and arrive early if your going for a more intimate diningexperience. The restaurant isnt huge and many of the seats are along the walkway which means you may have to wait for something specific if you didn't reserve ahead of time."

            "text": "One of the best steakhouses in all of NYC. We started with the Sea scallop and grilled bacon appetizers. I got the 24oz Bone in ribeye and my lady got the fillet mignon with the foie gras, and we finished with Creme Brule and Carrot cake. From the beginning to the end of the meal every single thing I tasted was better than the previous bite, overall one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and I'm fat so I've eaten a hell of a lot of food. But the best part of the meal was the service, sadly I forget the server's name but he was excellent, incredibly helpful, and insightful about how to pair different elements of the meal with the appropriate beverage. The attention to detail that is put into the space and the food is to be commended. One of NYC's best-kept secrets and I'll be going back."

            "text": "I made reservations at this place for my best friend's birthday. We arrived on time and were seated immediately. The restaurant is actually pretty small and cramped which it doesn't look like in pictures. Anyway, for appetizers we order the fried calamari and French onion soup . The Calamari was decent and the French onion soup was fair. For entrees, I ordered the Rib Eye with the bone with broccoli and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the T-Bone with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steaks were very thick but flavorful even though we both ordered medium rare and they both came out rare. The knives they have to cut the steaks are not real steak knives so it feels like you're sawing away trying to slice it. The mashed potatoes were decent for both of us but the broccoli was hard and the asparagus was bland. All in all, nothing in this place wowed me not even the service! And For the price point of this place I would not come back.\n\nAnd to top it off, after I signed the check and got up from the table to walk out, our waitress decided to grab me and tell me that the tip I gave \"was a mistake\" and not enough! Her exact words \"I think you made a mistake , we make $3.20 an hour, you need to tip more\". I asked her was the tip amount mandatory and she told me \"yes\". However that was a lie! Even on the receipt it says that it's \"suggested\". This is the same waitress who barely said a word to us, barely smiled, and rushed us throughout our dinner. I watched her spark up conversations with all her other tables but not us! She's lucky she got the amount I gave her! I told her she's needs to give better service to her black customers and walked away! Never again will I step foot back there, the food isn't even that great!"
