We ordered the fried calamari, the Linguini Seafood, and the Lobster Ravioli, everything was absolutely delicious. The calamari was perfectly cooked, tender, not chewy! and the pasta dishes were flavorful with beautiful presentation.\n\nOur server, Denis, was fantastic, attentive, friendly, and made the experience even better.\n\nCan’t wait to go back! 😋"

Schon beim Ankommen haben wir uns sehr wohlgefühlt: das Ambiente ist modern, stilvoll und trotzdem einladend. Man merkt sofort, dass hier viel Wert auf Details gelegt wird – von der Einrichtung bis hin zur Präsentation der Speisen.\n\nIch habe die Pasta Meatballs gewählt und war absolut begeistert. Die Pasta war perfekt al dente gekocht, die Sauce intensiv und harmonisch abgeschmeckt, und die Meatballs unglaublich zart und aromatisch – genau so, wie man es sich wünscht. Meine Frau hatte die Linguini mit Muscheln und auch dieses Gericht war hervorragend: die Muscheln frisch, die Pasta mit einer leichten, köstlichen Sauce, die das Meeresaroma perfekt unterstrichen hat.\n\nDazu kam ein sehr freundlicher und aufmerksamer Service, der unseren Besuch noch angenehmer gemacht hat. Man hatte nie das Gefühl, gehetzt zu werden, sondern konnte in Ruhe genießen.\n\nAlles in allem war es für uns ein echtes kulinarisches Highlight in Coney Island. Wir können TEURA jedem empfehlen, der Wert auf hervorragendes Essen, ein schönes Ambiente und freundlichen Service legt. Wir werden ganz sicher wiederkommen!"

We came all the way from the Bronx, and it was absolutely worth the trip. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was elegant, welcoming, and truly upscale.\n\nWe had the margarita pizza and mozzarella sticks, along with four glasses of wine, everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully prepared. Even though we arrived at 9:30 PM, just 30 minutes before their 10:00 PM closing, Denis, the manager that night, still welcomed us in with open arms. He went above and beyond to give my family and me the ultimate dining experience, making us feel like VIPs from start to finish.\n\nWe will definitely be back at an earlier time to explore more of the menu and we don’t want any other waiter but Denis! I even took some content to make a TikTok, and as soon as I post it, I’ll be tagging you guys!\n\nIf you’re looking for an unforgettable dining experience with incredible food and world-class service, Teura is the place to be."

About a week prior I spoke to the owner, Johnny, and he was very accommodating and said he would set up a nice table for the occasion. When we got to the restaurant he personally greeted us, and our server, Denis, welcomed us and showed us our table. They did a wonderful job of setting up something nice and even had cold moscato waiting for us. It was such a nice gesture on their part. The food was very good, but what we enjoyed most was the friendly staff and attentiveness. All of them, including the owner, the cook, and the servers Denis, and Jeffrey, were working hard to serve everyone as quickly as possible but still took time to answer our questions and make good recommendations. I highly recommend this restaurant and will tell our friends about it as well. The atmosphere was very pleasant and food was great. Thanks again!"

Once I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary, to our surprise our waiter immediately told us he was bringing a bt of champagne 🍾 on the house for us. A big surprise smile were on our faces and we thanked him for his hospitality.\nHe was so attentive during our visit and was NEVER in our way. He made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.\nThe story is not finished yet, we were so full, but he insisted we can try the desserts 🍮, well I went for the tiramisu. Now here is the best part, he brought an additional dessert (at no additional cost 💲) for the table. Both of them were very delicious and well received.\nI will highly recommend this Italian restaurant to everyone because it’s family oriented. This is our second time going there with the same treatment from what we remembered the very first time we walked through those doors. I have been recommending this place to everyone who is visiting the Coney Island area to pop in and try them out. You are not going to be disappointed with the service and the Food."

I understand it’s not always 100% basil, but in this case it didn’t taste like it at all. Even so, Jeff’s great service made up for it. Plus, the prices are very reasonable"

Just the bread and a tomato is a meal in itself.\n\n(From last year) What a gem to have in Coney Island! The pastas are homemade and simply delicious. Service is fantastic. Waitstaff is attentive and super friendly. If you're willing to pay $15 for over oily fried fish and chips on the boardwalk, come here instead. The atmosphere is lovely, very calming and the food is DELICIOUS! The pasta entrees range between $19 - $24.

I ordered the linguine seafood with white wine, butter, garlic and parsley sauce, and when I say it was top notch, oh boy do I mean it. I never thought that there was any comparison of my grandmother's calamari, but they take a close second place, and trust me, that's saying something. I have found my new go to for when I visit Coney Island"

I’m glad the tomatoes are not pastey like some other places. I also enjoyed the panna cotta which used real vanilla bean. I will be back. My sister lives near here and also recommends the lemon chicken."
