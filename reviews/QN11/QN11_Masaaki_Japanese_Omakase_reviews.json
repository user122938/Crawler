We ordered drinks first which came right away.  The waiters did a great job of bringing the food fast and gave us great suggestions on what to order. I got the sashimi dinner and tried a new roll with foie gras. It was the best roll I ever had and the sashimi was so fresh and delicious. I truly enjoyed the meal at this restaurant."

The Toro Tartare was incredibly fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, while the Miso Black Cod had that perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Foie Gras Roll? Pure indulgence.\n\nService was impeccable — attentive yet never intrusive, and the chef took time to explain the inspiration behind each course. You can really feel the passion and precision in every bite.\n\nIf you’re looking for high-quality Japanese cuisine with artistry and soul — this place is a must.\nA true Art of Omakase experience. Will definitely return soon!"

As soon as I stepped in, I was greeted by beautiful hand-painted artwork that covered the walls. I have tried both their Omakase and their regular menu items + cocktails.\n\nI was had the 15-course meal. (Heard the Omakase chef went to culinary school in Japan). Each course was art, beautifully presented…great flavor. The fish was fresh, some of the best I have ever tried. They have limited reservations available for Omakase, but this experience is definitely worth the splurge.\n\nI went back to try out their regular menu, and it is just as delicious. Generous portions. Try the Lobster Bisque\n\nDefinitely a regular here now."

            "text": "Masa Omakase – A Rare Culinary Experience\n\nMasa’s omakase is an experience in a category of its own. While many are familiar with the more casual à la carte section of Masa—perfect for a relaxed sushi bite—the omakase offering is an entirely different world.\n\nHere, you have the rare opportunity to witness Chef Masa Takayama himself at work. It’s intimate, precise, and deeply personal. Be prepared: this is not a light evening. The meal alone can run a few thousand dollars, not including pairings—and the portions are generous. I’d recommend arriving with an appetite; I made the mistake of eating earlier and couldn’t finish all the beautifully crafted dishes.\n\nWhat stood out was the chef’s attentiveness—he noticed my pace and subtly adjusted the portion sizes to match my intake. That kind of detail and awareness is rare.\n\nThis isn’t just a meal—it’s a masterclass in flavor, form, and reverence for tradition. If you have the chance, experience it while Chef Takayama is still with us. It’s a true honor."

Make sure to get their sashimi platter and rolls. They use premium raw fish that is fresh, fatty, and incredibly buttery.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and spacious, perfect for group gatherings or a cozy date night.\n\n＊Sashimi Deluxe $38 ***\nThe deluxe set consists of six assorted sashimi, including toro, salmon, yellowtail, and white fish. Every piece was fresh, fatty, and melt-in-your-mouth buttery. I loved the refreshing flavor and complex textures when I ate the sashimi with shiso leaf and shredded radish in a mouthful.\n\n＊Salmon Tartare $19.5 **\n100% recommend this sushi starter! You can pick salmon/tuna/toro as your raw fish topping. It was beautifully garnished with flowers and fish roe, drizzled in a yuzu ponzu sauce. The diced avocado was creamy and the citrusy note enhanced the depth of flavors.\n\n＊Sweet Heart Roll $21 *\nThey have a wide selection of creative rolls. These heart-shaped rolls were not only pretty but also delicious. Tuna fans would love this roll.\n\n＊Rainbow Roll $19\nYou can never go wrong with this classic roll combo: topped with salmon, tuna, white fish and avocado, and filled with crabmeat and cucumber\n\n＊Chicken Yakitori $12\nSaucy and smoky. The chicken breast was delicious with green pepper and onion."

The selection was nearly identical to what we typically get from another nearby sushi spot at a much lower cost. For us, it simply wasn’t worth the premium price, so we’ll be sticking to our regular spot in the future.\n\nOn a positive note, the service was good."

            "text": "For those of you who are looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant, this is for sure, not it. But if you are used to visiting Chinese owned Japanese restaurants, and are fine with their style/food, this place is very big and have a pretty good overall ambience. If you pay them cash, you get 5% discount.\n\nI made a last min same day omakase reservation and was able to get 2 seats. For a 5pm seating, we were seated at around 5:07pm. The group (everyone in that seating) was brought to the counter table which was at the back of restaurant. However the space is not entirely “private” for the counter seats, we were surrounded by other tables with large parties, and sometimes it can be loud. As we arrived at the counter, all of us just pretty much “picked our seats” instead of being brought to our specific seats like how Japanese omakase places would do.\n\nNot long after being seated, we were asked if we wanted to order any drinks without being asked if we wanted water or hot tea. I asked for hot tea and appreciated that it was an option. Then appetisers were served - all 3 of them were prepared at the wrong temperature, fish pieces were served too cold and overpowered with truffle oil and sesame sauce. The oyster piece was fine. The black miso cod was too salty and the chawan mushi was not smooth. We thought this dinner is ruined.\n\nThen the nigiri pieces were served. The first few pieces were fine, giving us some hope. They then started to sear a couple of fatty pieces and added very random toppings like very strong cheese over the king salmon. The tuna roll had too much pickles over tuna. And there’s just too much on a plate for the last plate with wagyu, uni, caviar, kinpaku, truffle, shiso flowers…\n\nSo perhaps this suits some diners, over decorated nigiri pieces, seared fatty pieces etc. Just not if you are looking for authentic Japanese omakase."

            "text": "When I enter a sushi restaurant, I know it is authentic Japanese because the sushi chefs will greet every guest who enters aloud in Japanese. That won't happen at Masaaki, because the chefs & staff are Chinese. FYI for those who are ignorant of Japanese custom. Keeping an open mind, I ordered tempura and sushi & sashimi lunch. The presentation and quality of raw fish were very good. Tempura was deep fried to perfection. No shortcuts with size of fish. Portion was very generous, especially for lunch. Interior is very clean & contemporary Japanese decor. Premium feel & quality come with premium price. However, as I already mentioned, the portion is generous. Service was adequate. Why not 5 stars? There was no bar seating in front of sushi chefs. I love to sit at a sushi bar to see the artistry & skill of a top sushi chef in real time. Oftentimes, some great conversations happen with them. The other reason is the fact I mentioned earlier. When I dine at a Szechuan house, I expect Chinese chefs & staff. I wouldn't want Koreans running the place. Likewise, a Japanese omakase should be run by Japanese people. To be very clear, this is a topic of race, culture, tradition & authenticity and not to be misunderstood as a racist comment. True foodies will understand. In any case, I recommend Masaaki, which is located in a quaint, cozy side street from the main stretch of the heart of Bayside restaurant district.
