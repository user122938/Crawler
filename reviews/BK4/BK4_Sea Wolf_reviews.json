We sat down at a high top and while she was accommodating by switching us to a regular table she barely said two words to us. We ordered the seafood tower and they forgot the claw crackers, napkins and spare plates for shells. The Diet Coke was flat and undrinkable and the soup we got was mid at best. The lobster bisque was a spicy tomato soup at best and the clam chowder was just a cream soup. While eating it my partner noticed a “string” like object in her chowder. I showed it to our waitress and she showed the manager, she showed the chef and the conclusion they came up with was a sliver of an onion peel. We were so turned off. They took the sodas off the bill but not the soup.\nI would never recommend this place EVER to anyone."

The highlight of the meal was without a doubt the lobster mac and cheese — rich, creamy, and packed with flavor, it’s easily one of the best I’ve ever had.\n\nEvery bite was indulgent but perfectly balanced, with generous chunks of lobster that made it feel really special. On top of the incredible food, the service was equally impressive.\n\nOur server Emma was attentive and made us feel truly taken care of throughout the night. She checked in often without hovering and made sure everything was just right. Between the amazing food and excellent service, Sea Wolf delivered a five-star experience I can’t wait to repeat."

I arrived with optimistic high hopes, and to my dismay they were marginally under ceded. I had the pleasure of having a lovely waitress, however this perk was extremely undermined how the management treat their workers. This sort of attitude towards the staff took away from the  experience itself, and I hope that action is taken place or a bad review would be the least of the restaurants problems."

I’ve been going here for years and it’s only recently service is changed. New servers need to learn and study the menu much better, kitchen needs better communication with servers on orders, plates all need to be checked for accuracy with the menu by kitchen, server and mgmt before heading to the table. Service should include offering condiments with certain dishes, and there should be better follow up after food is served. My brunch item was all kinds of messed up, table water tasted off. Maybe just an off day but it’s obvious new mgmt needs much improvement. Bathrooms were horrendous. Cooks are still amazing tho. I’ll give this place another chance bc it’s always been one of my favorites."

The actual hostess was outside singing and in between songs she was running drinks but not seating anyone she didn’t know. So by the time I was able to get someone’s attention it was 9:20  I tried to get someones attention but I don’t think the backwaters speak decent English then I was able to send up a flare so the only waitress in the building helped me and i ended up ordering the fish n chips with a side of Mac and cheese with a threes brewing Pilsner.

Despite being knee-deep in a whirlwind of orders, he moved like a pro: quick, focused, and somehow still warm and attentive. Our drinks and food came out fast! Like, impressively fast. Watching him work was like watching a bartender ballet.\n\nThe oysters were fresh and briny, the fries golden and crispy, and the frozen drinks? Chef’s kiss. Just the right hit of booze and slush.\n\nHonestly, I’d come back just to sit at the bar and watch Marcus do his thing again. 10/10 would recommend, especially if you love a good bar show and damn good oysters."

We loved everything we ordered. However our waiter consistently forgot about us. I’m not sure if it was because we were outside or what.

HH wings are $9 for 5 pieces...l've had a better HH deal elsewhere, esp given that these wings weren't evenly coated and we only received 1 flat piece vs 4 drumsticks. I ordered their Beyond Burger, which had an overwhelming amount of cheese, but was otherwise cooked nicely! I wish their salad had more to it, it was simply just kale and dressing. Not even tomatoes, onions, or other toppings.\nThis place fell short on staff. We tried to order another round of drinks THREE times, and each time, a server looked directly as us and walked away. We even flagged them down, and they claimed that they had to grab a specific person to put in our order, but we were never tended to. I'm not sure if it was be we were a table of 4 Asians, but it felt a bit that way..\nGiven my unfortunate experience with the staff, 1 won't be returning."

            "text": "Frist of all, I love coming to eat around the area since it was becoming so popular for the restaurant. We made a reservation through the app but after they seated us, the server tends to forget about us so we waited for a while to get serve that was turn off for a place that such a popular.\n\nWe had 4 sets of appetizers since my husband wanted something different than me and we didn't agree.\nHe had.....\n- fried Calamari: 8/10: it was crispy and I tried some of them\n- Chili Crisp Shrimp: 6/10: I gave this score because it was only 5 shrimp and the sauce and how they prepared and cooked the shrimp wasn't reach my Afor the price of $18 this dish should be only $13\nI had......\n- A dozen of Oyster: it was ok with happy hour price for $1.5 each\n- A dozen of middle neck clams for $1.75 each\nOverall my raw bar was good, I love cocktail sauce and spicy sauce they gave me.\nFor the main curse we both had a whole lobster which i'm ok to work with but my lazy husband only want to have lobster tail but they didn't have anything closer. I ended up have to cracked all shell of the lobster which i didn't mind but I may have to open a Lobster farm to serve my huband who only wants to to eat lobter tale for his laziness. LOL.\n\nOverall, We made a reservation and it was good until we sat to our table. The server let us wait for a while until he realize we were a new customer and didn't order anything yet. The place seem to be busy and lots of worker tend to avoid you when you need something which was bad.\n\nMy first approached was very polite and looking around to see anyone available or eyes contact with me. After no one avoiding, so I start to call when someone passing by. I understand if you are busy but communication is must. Good server should at least tell the customer they saw it and they will be back. I don't mind waiting as long as they know they will come back.\n\nThis Seafood place is good but if you go when they are busy maybe you cann't expect the good service. Food was good just people who works there were less care."

Do yourself a favor and get any and all of the drinks but the watermelon Sugar high is especially tasty.\n\nAll the apps are crazy, but the tuna Crudo, and the ceviche are extra special. You have to get a Lobster of course, but you are full. If you don’t get the lobster mac & cheese, it’s literally so good you won’t want to share!"

Food was super fresh and everyone agreed it was tasty. Drinks were strong. My only con is the quality is much different when I order delivery. Nonetheless, I’ll still return to try out more items from their menu."

Service was not kind or apologetic about it either.\n\nShoulda left then and there but hoped the food was good - it was disappointing and just too expensive for the portions served. Seafood lovers you are better off finding quality grub elsewhere, feels like this place does not get a lot of repeat customers for good reason."

The frozen PainKiller cocktail hits the spot and goes beautifully with their other bar food, especially the tempura asparagus and the fish tacos. We were there for the 4th of July long weekend and went everyday."

I would highly recommend trying their  shrimp basket, oysters and Pain Killer(perfect pre-game drink).\n\nService: The service was great! The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very friendly.\n\nAmbiance: This is a very chill and relaxed restaurant. The vibe is giving casual beach club. This def a spot I would come with friends and pre-game before going out.\n\nOverall: I would highly recommend giving them a try and for more reviews check out my Instagram @EmmesEverydayEats!"
